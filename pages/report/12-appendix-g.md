title: "Appendix G: Summary of Comments Received"
permalink: /report/appendices/summary-of-comments/
---

More than 100 companies and individuals submitted comments during the
three week public comment period for the IT Modernization Report.
Overall, the comments reaffirmed the importance of modernizing Federal
IT, and validated that the proposed approach is on the right track. The
comments offered diverse and at times conflicting suggestions, and
ranged from strategic thoughts to detailed implementation guidance.

The ATC strove to keep this report at a strategic level, and will make
the more detailed ‘implementation level’ comments available to the teams
who will drive specific modernization efforts across Federal IT. Several
comments also noted the need to fundamentally reform or tweak current
statutory provisions, and the ATC will provide these recommendations to
existing activities which are already charged with these statutory
reform areas.

All comments received are publically posted, but this appendix will
highlight some of the key themes that emerged during the comment review.

**Need for technical diversity and efficiency**

Many comments stressed the need to future-proof the Government’s
systems, keep pace with innovation and future standards, maintain vendor
and technology neutrality, and recognize the validity of diverse
approaches to securing data, applications, networks, and services.
Comments also suggested adopting modern approaches to development and
operations such as DevOps and continuous delivery and automate more of
the functional/security testing, integration, deployment, and operations
of applications.

**Accreditation and cybersecurity**

Comments emphasized the benefits of leveraging FedRAMP authorization,
suggested improvements to the FedRAMP process, asserted need to enforce
reciprocity, suggested utilizing the native security capabilities (such
as machine learning and big data analytics) offered by the cloud service
providers, and potential for automating the sharing of classified threat
intelligence with cleared service providers.

**Network modernization and data level security**

Comments emphasized the importance of network level security, advised
that tools should focus on outcomes not mechanisms, that controls must
be placed in closer proximity to the data, and that users, cloud APIs,
and individual devices need to be considered as access control shifts
from the network perimeter. Comments also emphasized that controls must
be placed in closer proximity to the data, and that cloud access
security brokers (CASBs) should be used to provide secure access to
cloud resources.

**Acquisition strategy and workforce**

Several comments indicated concern over halting or pausing acquisitions
in progress, the need for reform of the acquisition and budgeting
processes, and observations that acquisition cycles needed to become
more rapid and agile. Comments also suggested that the acquisition of
modern IT requires a holistic approach (technical, cybersecurity, and
contracting) supported by a trained and experienced workforce.

**Shared services and the acquisition pilot**

Comments suggested that the discussion and policy around shared service
be clarified. Several comments mentioned that contract consolidation on
EIS was essential, while others mentioned that the strategy might stifle
innovation and competition. The ATC is committed to the strategy of
leveraging the competitively awarded EIS contract to assist with
consolidation efforts. Comments suggested that the acquisition pilot
would be useful in proving out the Government’s objectives, while others
suggested it too narrowly scoped. Comments also recommended that
specific vendor names be removed from the notional examples in the
appendix.

Examples of key points derived from the comments is included in the
section below.

**Question 1 - What are major attributes that are missing from the
targeted vision? (Appendix A, Appendix B)**

Comments, in response to this question suggested the report should:

> \(i) make clear the section only described some of the approaches to be
> used;
>
> \(ii) include the concept of logical vice physical separation of data;
>
> \(iii) consider including multi-factor authentication;
>
> \(iv) consider including the concept of least privilege;
>
> \(v) consider expanding the discussion regarding software lifecycle
> automation and security testing.

Many of the comments confirmed that the attributes were on the right
track or offered additional suggestions and insights to attributes
proffered within the report.

**Question 2 - What are major attributes that should not be included in
the targeted vision?**

Comments, in response to this question, suggested the report should:

> \(i) remove references to specific companies;
>
> \(ii) remove or revise the suggestion that agencies halt procurement
> actions that are underway;
>
> \(iii) expand the description and approaches to cybersecurity assessment
> and authorization.

Many of the comments confirmed that the attributes were on the right
track or offered additional suggestions and insights to attributes
proffered within the report.

**Question 3 - Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for
implementing network modernization & consolidation?**

**Question 4 - Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for
implementing shared services to enable future network architectures?**

Comments and recommendations in response to questions 3 and 4 were
similar and suggested or implied that the report:

> \(i) should clarify the definition, description, and/or purpose of
> employing shared services;
>
> \(ii) should identify and address obstacles to adopting shared services
> or network consolidation;
>
> \(iii) should, relative to item (ii) recommend that a greater focus and
> actions be placed on addressing issues relative to the FAR;
>
> \(iv) should acknowledge need to reuse existing accreditation packages
> (aka foster reciprocity among agencies);
>
> \(v) relative to item (iv) above, should suggest an activity to improve
> reciprocity and identify capabilities to automate NIST RMF Framework;
>
> \(vi) reinforce the need for training and career development for
> professionals involved in accomplishing the goals articulated in the
> report.

Many of the comments confirmed that the tasks were appropriate and/or
offered additional enhancement to the identified tasks.

**Question 5 What is the feasibility of the proposed acquisition pilot?
(Appendix D)**

Comments, in response to this question, suggested that the report:

> \(i) should clarify the intent, purpose, scope, expected outcomes, and
> assessment criteria of-and-for the pilot;
>
> \(ii) should consider expanding the pilot to other shared services;
>
> \(iii) should de-identify service providers and include contracting
> options.

The comments generally confirmed that a pilot was a valid idea and
offered additional suggestions, approaches, and identified potential
pit-falls.

We want to express appreciation for the sincerity, depth of thought, and
time taken by each of the commenters and encourage the community to go
to the public website and read each of the submissions.
