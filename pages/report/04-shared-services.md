## Summary of Efforts to Date

Category Management and Shared Services are both industry leading
practices that help the Federal Government deliver common functions in a
more effective and efficient way. Category Management allows the
Government to buy more like a single enterprise by purchasing
commodities and common services consistently and with minimal variation
to leverage the Government’s buying power. Government-wide Category
Managers identify “Best in Class” (BIC) solutions, which are contracting
and acquisition designations used to denote contracts that meet rigorous
category management criteria as defined by OMB. These designated BICs
allow acquisition experts to take advantage of pre-vetted,
Government-wide contract solutions. As stated earlier, Shared Services
is the provision of consolidated capabilities or functions (services
and/or IT systems) that are common across multiple agencies. Shared
information technology relieves customer agencies of managing upgrade
cycles, maintenance, and acquisition overhead associated with supporting
duplicative mission support technologies.

Shared Services intersects with Information Technology Category
Management in that common solutions developed under Category Management
should be leveraged by all agencies, including organizations providing
shared services. Providers assume the responsibility for customers of
managing the contracts/orders, ensuring scalability and efficiency of
services, holding vendors accountable for meeting performance metrics,
and delivering continuous improvement of business process.

Shared services has a long history in the Federal Government and gained
momentum with the establishment of functional lines of business with the
*E-Government Act of 2002*. Building upon this progress and leveraging
best practices from the private sector, in October 2015, OMB announced
the formation of the Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) office
within GSA to enable the delivery of high-quality, high-value shared
services that improve performance and efficiency throughout the Federal
Government. USSM’s mission is to transform the way Government does
business internally to improve the way the Government serves the
American public.

While there has long been interest in shared services for general IT
needs, a perilous threat environment has resulted in a need for
cybersecurity shared services as well as commercially-provided commodity
IT, such as email, and the cloud. Not only would the widespread use and
deployment of shared services in information security provide cost
savings, they would also provide a more consistent level of security
across the Federal enterprise.

## Current State

Addressing security challenges is critical if the Federal Government
expects to achieve strong security outcomes; however, the current model
of distributed Federal IT makes tackling complex resource-intensive
problems in a consistent manner challenging. Today, each agency must
independently identify possible vendors, evaluate the security of the
vendors, issue an ATO, integrate the solution into their own independent
bespoke IT infrastructure, and allocate resources to monitor and operate
that infrastructure on an ongoing basis. The combination of these
factors does not achieve consistent, high-quality security outcomes.

The Federal Government is the world’s largest buyer and there is a
critical need to change the way the Federal Government buys common
information technology products and services. Transitioning to
consolidated network architectures and shared services requires
consideration of how these products or services will be acquired.
Current challenges associated with use of commercial acquisition
practices limit the Federal Government’s ability to achieve its
modernization goals.

Significant contract duplication means that agencies award multiple
contracts for similar goods and services, often leading to hundreds, if
not thousands, of contracts for the same requirement with the same
vendors. Additionally, there are huge price variances for the exact same
item, sometimes as much as 300 - 400 percent. Agencies work highly
autonomously, with only occasional collaboration across organizations
and little sharing of information, standards, and best practices. This
degree of fragmentation, lack of common standards, and lack of
coordination drives costly redundancies and inefficiencies in
procurement actions, contracting vehicles, and customization of common
information technology solutions.

The existing federated and distributed approach to IT is no longer
sustainable in an increasingly mobile, cloud-based, and complex digital
world. Building or internally operating such security programs requires
specialized cybersecurity talent and knowledge, access to a broad range
of data sources to manage the latest threats, and sophisticated and
costly emulation and static analysis technology. This is an immense
undertaking for large departments, but even more so for smaller and
non-CFO Act agencies who often struggle with basic security functions,
such as vulnerability mitigation, due to resource limitations. Programs
like CDM are taking steps toward deploying common tools across all
agencies and integrating large and small agencies into a shared
cybersecurity understanding; however, many of these programs, including
CDM, have been mired by delays and have not yet yielded their full
promise.

## Future State & Objectives

In order to reduce cost, improve operational efficiencies and
cybersecurity, the Federal Government must shift toward a consolidated
IT model. This includes adopting shared services for non-mission
specific functions, as well as BIC contracts, commodity IT, such as
email, and other collaboration productivity, and security tools. This
approach will help the Federal Government rapidly deploy new
capabilities that will enhance agencies’ abilities to perform their
missions and secure their networks. The Federal Government must embrace
the broader use of cloud services while working to develop cloud
products that meet Federal cybersecurity standards. With the proper type
of cloud offering designed with an appropriate focus on security, the
increased use and consolidation of IT services in multi-tenant cloud
services can provide the visibility and control necessary to deploy
data-level protections and automated cybersecurity outlined earlier in
this report. Agencies must leverage shared services and embrace
commercial technologies such as Software as a Service (SaaS) where
possible, building new capabilities only when shared services and
commercial technologies cannot meet mission need.

The [NIST Definition of Cloud Computing (SP 800-145)][SP-800-145] establishes the
essential characteristics and service model definition for cloud-based
SaaS, which also serves as the definition for this Report and its
implementation. Transitioning to a consumption-based service, as opposed
to traditional approaches of purchasing on-premise licenses, will enable
the Government to stop building systems that are expensive to maintain
and modernize. Among other benefits, the Government will only pay for
what it uses, better leverage its buying power, achieve the benefits of
continuous modernization, and gain economies of scale from
standardization.

As Federal agencies increase their investment in commercial cloud
services, promoting vendor interoperability and avoidance of “vendor
lock-in” will continue to be important priorities. Where feasible and
appropriate, the use of tools and platforms that can be used portably
across multiple underlying cloud service providers is encouraged.
Agencies of any significant size, such as CFO Act agencies, are
generally expected to authorize and make use of multiple independent
cloud environments. At the same time, agencies are encouraged to make
use of the best and most cutting-edge services that cloud service
providers have available. This can include services that may be specific
to individual providers’ and which are optimized for their strengths.

In general, agencies should avoid unhealthy levels of dependence on
specific vendors, while taking advantage of the best technologies the
commercial market has to offer.

In order to achieve the desired future state, the Government must
address the current impediments in policy, resource allocation,
Government-wide business standards, and disparate agency interpretations
of statutes and guidance, in addition to other considerations that are
obstacles to agencies’ adoption of shared and cloud services. Such
obstacles include statutory and regulatory requirements that prevent the
use of accepted commercial best acquisition practices. Changes and
modifications to the existing acquisition requirements could be
implemented to achieve efficiencies while maintaining the core tenet of
fairness. Rather than relying on often outdated and agency-specific
systems, the Government should speak with one voice to providers to
obtain systems and services that offer world-class levels of
functionality that meets the Government-wide business standards, achieve
cost-effectiveness through economies of scale, and are secure.

## Implementation Plan

Both the short- and long-term steps outlined in this section will result
in greater innovation across the Federal enterprise, decrease costs, and
dramatically improve services provided to both agencies and citizens.
These interventions will allow agencies, and particularly smaller
agencies, to more easily acquire and adopt commodity cloud
infrastructure products, while leveraging the Federal Government’s
buying power to produce economies of scale. Additionally, these efforts
will augment existing agency-specific technology to improve both
visibility and security. This implementation plan focuses on three key
areas viewed as pivotal for accelerating the move to shared services:
(1) enabling the use of commercial cloud services and infrastructure;
(2) accelerating adoption of cloud email and collaboration tools; and
(3) providing additional and improving existing shared services.

### 1.  Enable the Use of Commercial Cloud Services and Infrastructure

Major commercial cloud infrastructure providers offer excellent levels
of functionality, cost effectiveness, and security because of their
ability to aggregate demand across a broad range of customers. There are
a wide range of ways each of the models outlined below can drive cloud
adoption by Government customers; however, it is generally helpful to
think about the options as one default approach and a second option when
security requirements require it.

-   **"Bring the Government to the Cloud."** This approach is the
    recommended default approach the Government should utilize and is
    characterized by multitenant commercially owned infrastructure
    (e.g., building servers, networks, applications) that is shared with
    other non-Government customers, but in which Government data is
    protected through security technologies and encryption.

-   **“Bring the Cloud to the Government."** This approach is
    characterized by multitenant Government-owned and -operated
    infrastructure (e.g., buildings, servers, networks, applications) or
    commercially owned and operated infrastructure isolated and
    dedicated for Government use.

In order to ensure a smooth adoption of cloud technologies across the
Government, it is important to understand the various models that are
available for utilizing cloud services. The following two options
describe the main approaches in which the Government has adopted cloud
services and how these models could be adjusted moving forward.

#### Bring Government to the Cloud: Vendor-owned and operated servers and applications — Software as a Service (SaaS)

This is the ubiquitous public cloud model used by the vast majority of
private sector cloud providers, and is in use by some Federal agencies
today. Among other uses, this model may be appropriate for modern
cloud-hosted email, productivity, and collaboration tools and mission
support services.

Many agencies have already fully embraced vendor-operated, cloud-based
collaboration and productively tools, and, depending on the agency, may
have several such tools based on commercial SaaS in use today in their
environment. It is important for the rest of Government to migrate from
legacy offerings to take advantage of the increased productivity and
innovation that these cloud based services offer.

#### Bring Government to the Cloud: Vendor-owned and operated servers and Government-operated applications with networks that utilize a secure connection — Infrastructure as a Service

Some service needs can only be met by developing custom software, or by
buying software not available as a service. With this model, a cloud
vendor owns and operates servers in a private sector data center, but
connected through a secure connection. Secure connections could include
HTTPS, TLS, peering, etc. This provides an infrastructure upon which
agencies deploy applications that they create or acquire. This model can
be utilized for secure, critical applications that are only available to
Government users on a virtual private network (VPN) or other
network-level isolation.

Because Infrastructure as a Service gives customers control over many
low-level details, it can entirely replace the need for a traditional on
premise data center. Agencies can often move existing services from
legacy on premise data centers to cloud infrastructure with some
software modifications.

These applications can be public services used by the general public or
private internal services used by agency employees. In either case,
agencies may consider cloud infrastructure as a service to be an
extension of their existing private enterprise network, or they may
treat it as a separate, isolated network. Regardless, users access the
service through secure connections, which could include HTTPS, TLS, VPN,
or a dedicated line.

Infrastructure as a service excels at providing a platform for creating
and deploying the digital services that are core to an agency’s mission.
These models are already in use by agencies in a wide range of use cases
including benefits processing for veterans, immigration, and healthcare,
as well as data processing and software testing in the Department of
Defense community.

#### Bring the Cloud to Government: Government-owned data center buildings with vendor-owned and operated services

For certain applications where using the Internet is not a viable
option, commercial providers can operate infrastructure in
Government-owned facilities. This is attractive for classified systems
that cannot be connected to the public Internet. For example, the
intelligence community was the original adopter of a model in which
vendor-owned and operated services were based out of Government-owned
data center buildings. An example of this approach is the Intelligence
Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE) Commercial Cloud
Services.

This model is much more expensive than fully commercial cloud services,
and cannot keep pace with the innovation of public cloud solutions. As
such, it is only appropriate where the Government absolutely must retain
physical control over the infrastructure.

It is important to be wary of on premise solutions that are sold with
cloud terminology that do not actually meet [the NIST Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing][SP-800-145]. Often, products that claim to
offer private cloud infrastructure fail to deliver on these promises,
missing key aspects such as rapid elasticity, on-demand self-service, or
resource pooling.

#### Bring the Cloud to Government: Vendor-owned and operated data centers with servers dedicated for Government use

Many cloud service providers offer Government-dedicated versions of
their services, where the provider builds segregated space for
Government use so that agency customers only share logical space
(possibly including servers, buildings, networks, personnel) with other
Government customers. This allows a provider to more easily meet
Government-specific compliance requirements for securing sensitive data.

This model provides a middle ground between public shared cloud
infrastructure and costly on premise infrastructure. It is used by many
agencies today to house applications where legal, compliance, or
security reasons preclude the use of shared servers.

This model, which is already in use, could be particularly useful and
appropriate for hosting Government websites and services for
infrastructure that may have sensitivities for which public servers
would not be appropriate.

**Recommendations:**

Cloud is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and offers a multitude of
options for agencies based on their needs and preferences. While it is
important to ensure flexibility across the Federal Government, there are
a few models that can cover the majority of Federal use cases. As such,
the Government should invest in two to three cloud models to support the
differing security and risk-tolerance postures of agencies and leverage
shared services. Further, agencies should work cooperatively and
collaboratively to build trust within their own enterprise and between
agencies so that Federal programs and system owners can make maximum use
of authorization packages, compliance materials, and any other documents
or process that promotes reuse and appropriate risk acceptance when
deciding to bring new systems online or evaluate legacy systems for
migration or decommissioning.

In particular, the Government should expand its use of the “Bring the
Government to the Cloud” models, as these best balance the benefits of
cloud computing—including improved performance and cost-savings—with
outsourced security and control. While the impending revisions to the
TIC policy and guidance will affect some of the eventual business
decisions surrounding cloud options, agencies should begin working to
determine how best to use the models outlined above.

Next steps to support the above recommendations are
as follows:

**Within 30 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

Pursuant to its statutory authorities and in execution thereof, OMB
will conduct a data call requesting that agencies identify systems
that may be ready for cloud migration and can be migrated securely but
have not yet migrated due to perceived or encountered difficulties. At
the conclusion of this data call, OMB and GSA will review the
impediments to moving to the cloud outlined by agencies and will
prioritize an infusion of technical talent, capital, and updated
security policy (developed iteratively to solve agency-specific
issues) as needed to enable prioritized cloud migrations. This task is
described in more detail in the following section.

**Within 90 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

GSA will work with volunteer agencies to pilot new initiatives to
improve the speed, reliability, reusability, and risk acceptance
transparency for cloud-based SaaS and shared services ATOs. Initial
pilots will test new authorities and tools for authorization processes
as automation of the new NIST Risk Management Framework for select
information systems, implementing the new FedRAMP Tailored baseline
for low-impact SaaS products, and leveraging Authorizations to Use for
shared services based on commercial cloud offerings.

Based on the combined efforts, including lessons learned and best
practices for extending these pilot activities to a Federal
civilian-wide scale, GSA will work with OMB to develop any necessary
plans or policy for promoting these initiatives and any other
innovative FedRAMP, shared services, or agency-specific efforts across
the Federal enterprise.

**Within 120 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

Pursuant to its statutory authorities and in execution thereof, OMB,
in coordination with DHS, GSA, and its Federal partners, will update
[the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy][25-POINT-PLAN] (“Cloud-First”). This
strategy will provide additional guidance to agencies on the most
impactful use cases for cloud adoption and how best to conduct
appropriate operational security in cloud environments.

Additionally, OMB will conduct a thorough review of all relevant
policies pertaining to IT modernization, cloud migration,
infrastructure consolidation, and shared services, among others, and
will initiate revisions, rescissions, or other rapid policy updates
that may improve the ability of agencies to modernize effectively,
securely, and efficiently. If necessary, OMB will issue further
guidance that will augment and enhance existing Federal technology and
information security policy.

OMB, working with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Council,
GSA, and DHS will develop clauses that define consistent requirements
for security, privacy, and access to data for use in cloud contracts.
These clauses will ensure uniformity in contract language and provide
rigor to standard Government terms, which would be particularly
valuable to agencies lacking relevant technical, legal, or
acquisitions expertise to craft, out of whole cloth, such language in
their cloud procurements.

**Within 180 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB, working with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR
Council) and DHS will develop clauses that define consistent
requirements for security, privacy, and access to data for use in
cloud contracts. These clauses will ensure uniformity in contract
language and clear direction in standard Government terms, which would
be particularly valuable to agencies lacking relevant technical,
legal, or acquisitions expertise to craft, out of whole cloth, such
language in their cloud procurements.

These actions are in addition to OMB’s ongoing work with the FAR
Council to reduce regulatory burden on federal IT contractors pursuant
to E.O. 13771, as well as efforts with members of the Chief
Acquisition Officers Council to identify statutory or administrative
changes to align federal procurement practices with successful
commercial buying strategies and collaboration with agency Acquisition
Innovation Advocates to apply modernized processes to improve the
acquisition system’s ability to support the goals of this report.

### 2. Accelerate Adoption of Cloud Email and Collaboration Tools

Accelerated adoption of tools like cloud email and collaboration
applications is an essential element to achieving timely collaboration
capability across the Government. Deploying these tools for the Federal
Government sooner rather than later minimizes exposure of one the most
prominent cyberattack methods in modern society. Targeted, email-based
spear phishing attacks using malicious attachments and links are the
primary attack vector for compromising individuals and organizations.

Accelerated rollout of cloud email and collaboration is urgent given the
number of duplicative legacy systems and their associated cybersecurity
risks. In addition, even within cloud-based email, there still exists
price variance. Agencies generally negotiate as individual organizations
- thus limiting the potential economy of scale that could have been
achieved negotiating through the Government Enterprise. Buying power
through Government-wide price negotiations will achieve efficiencies of
cost savings and therefore benefit American taxpayers.

In order to support agencies in moving away from their own email servers
and solutions, a set of secure, easy-to-maintain, and cost-effective
solutions must be available. Industry is well positioned to provide
effective security controls, especially when paired with NCPS
capabilities and to enable agencies to leverage improved mobile, tablet,
and productivity operating environments. There are currently only two
hosted solutions deployed in the Federal Government, though additional
competitors could emerge. Regardless, a requirement to make better use
of cloud-based email and collaboration services increases the
Government’s leverage in obtaining farther reaching innovative solutions
and better pricing.

While the benefits are worthwhile, ranging from cost savings to improved
security, the migration itself to cloud-based tools can be costly and
burdensome, particularly for smaller agencies. In order to support
agencies in their migration, a set of secure, easy-to-maintain, and
cost-effective solutions must be made available.

The Government must pursue new acquisition strategies to obtain cloud
email and collaboration tools and services. In furtherance of this
objective, pilots such as the example outlined in Appendix D may be
executed to decrease the administrative acquisition burden, specifically
for smaller agencies who cannot leverage large volume discounts or who
have acquisition workforce constraints. Additional pilots may include
the ability to purchase cloud services on a consumption basis and
coordinated purchasing to obtain tiered-based pricing.

One of the fundamental advantages the Government has in seeking products
and services is that its size should allow it to leverage competing
market forces to drive Government-wide volume pricing and increase the
overall speed of migration. The goal would be to incentivize providers
through tiered pricing, business strategies, and service level
agreements that would produce insight and transparency into any
agreement made to obtain cloud email and collaboration tools by the
Government.

This would mark a significant departure from existing acquisition
marketplaces where existing models are laborious for both Government and
industry and fail to truly capture and make transparent items such as
volume spending as an aggregated value. In addition, the current process
does not always offer sufficient transparency, allowing some agencies to
pay less than others. Often, it is the small agencies, who can least
afford higher prices, that are penalized.

Next steps to support the above recommendations are as follows:

**Within 30 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will conduct a data call to agencies regarding their current email
contracts, prices, and number of mailboxes. It is imperative that the
Government obtain an accurate measurement of the market size of
agencies who have not yet migrated to cloud email. While there are
clear data on the current need among CFO Act agencies, there is
currently no definitive data regarding the adoption of cloud-based
email solutions at small and independent agencies. Understanding the
full size of the marketplace will enable the Government to maximize
its leverage in negotiations with cloud collaboration vendors.

OMB will convene a task force of agencies to finalize a standard set
of requirements for cloud email, including both low and moderate
security postures for email and cloud collaboration. These
requirements, which will build upon previously completed work, will be
circulated to all agencies for comment and serve as the basis for
acquisition.

**Within 60 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will establish a comprehensive strategy for driving the
accelerated migration of agency email and collaboration tools to the
cloud for departments and agencies who have still not adopted
cloud-based email. This strategy should emphasize achieving both cost
savings and improved security.

**Within 75 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will issue updated identity policy guidance for public comment
that will reduce agency burden and recommend identity service areas
suitable for shared services. GSA will provide a business case to the
Federal CIO on the consolidation of existing identity services to
improve usability and drive secure access and interoperability. This
action will enable secure access and collaboration as a service in a
way that improves existing agency-specific implementations, which
often have various levels of security and do not include
interoperability.

**Within 90 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will assemble an Acquisition Tiger Team (ATT), which will be
charged with drafting and disseminating a “quick start” acquisition
package that can help agencies facilitate rapid license and migration
service acquisitions. This will make it possible for agencies to award
licenses and services that may presently have difficulty doing so. The
“quick start” package would include market research, acquisition
plans, templates for requesting quotes, identified sources of supply,
and Independent Government Cost Estimate calculation templates (based
on already completed acquisitions).

The ATT, working through the appropriate executive agent, will send
out Requests for Information (RFIs) or conduct other market research
activities to find qualified small business and socio-economic
concerns to leverage set aside programs and other authorities to
streamline the migration acquisitions to the greatest extent possible.
For example, using the [8(a) Digital Service Initiative][TECHFAR-8A] or vehicles
that have resulted from Category Management efforts in this
space.

**Within 180 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

The Government should consider incentives for early adoption
(migration in the first year following the formalization of the
effort), including individualized assistance tailored to a given
agency’s needs. To assist in such an effort, OMB will create
acquisition/migration cadres, consisting of information technology and
acquisition specialists that will be sent to early adopter agencies to
help with license and migration acquisitions-related challenges.
Initially, these cadres would draw from agencies that have already
completed their migrations, such as the Department of the Justice
(DOJ) and acquisition experts from the Digital IT Acquisition
Professional Training (DITAP) alumni network.

**Within 240 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB, with support from GSA, will pilot new acquisition tactics for
cloud email and collaboration licenses including but not limited to
those discussed above and outlined in Appendix D.

**Other High-Level Actions:**

Approved FISMA-Moderate cloud-based collaboration tools currently
exist. GSA will continue to work with existing cloud email and
collaboration providers, and will prioritize approval of a FISMA-High
offering. At the same time, process improvements will continue
iteratively to enable agencies to accelerate adoption of cloud
services.

Within the Federal Government, having a qualified and agile
acquisition workforce is paramount to ensure the Federal Government
acquires optimal solutions to achieve successful acquisition outcomes.
Providing specialized training and career development opportunities
for the acquisition workforce is a critical component for ensuring tax
payer dollars are effectively managed and obligated to achieve the
requirements addressed in the Federal IT Modernization Report.
Providing training and career development opportunities is a
priority for cybersecurity adoption, cloud email, and cloud adoption.
The Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) core plus
specialization in digital services is under review and is a component
of the DITAP development program. The DITAP program focuses on
providing contracting professionals with training and experiential
learning opportunities to gain the expertise necessary to better
understand the market conditions and drivers, effectively manage risks
to successfully plan, and negotiate and acquire digital supplies and
services. Moreover, completion of the DITAP development
program empowers the graduates to serve as change agents and expert
business advisors to members of the integrated acquisition team
(program managers, legal, finance, contracting officer's
representative and other stakeholders). Having a Government-wide,
holistic and integrated training and career development approach is
vital to deliver results to the American People and build a stronger
more capable Federal Government.

### 3. Improve Existing and Provide Additional Security Shared Services

As cyberattacks have become more sophisticated, frequent, and easier for
adversaries to execute, cybersecurity has continued to escalate as a
primary responsibility for all individual agencies and for the Federal
Government as a whole. Addressing cybersecurity threats holistically
necessitates both a further consolidation of the Federal Government’s IT
footprint as well as an expansion of shared, centralized services to
better leverage Federal buying power, standardize security capabilities,
improve the time it takes to detect and respond to incidents, and
realize economies of scale from aggregating data.

**Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM)**

DHS established the CDM Program in 2013 to provide Federal civilian
agencies with automated continuous monitoring tools to detect
vulnerabilities and potentially malicious network activity in near
real-time.[^23] [^24] CDM Phase 1, which is currently being deployed,
is designed to determine “what is on the network” by providing agencies
with capabilities to identify and remediate vulnerabilities and ensure
secure hardware and software configurations on their networks. CDM Phase
2 will focus on “who is on the network” and provide capabilities to
detect and manage privileged user access and ensure that only
authorized, credentialed users have access to information on the
network. CDM Phase 3 will report “what is happening on the network” and
provide capabilities to identify and assess anomalies that may indicate
a cybersecurity compromise and to implement ongoing assessment and
authorization. CDM Phase 4 will focus on expanding data protections for
Government information. All CDM capabilities will feed information to
both an agency- and Federal-level dashboard, enabling Government-wide
visibility into the current state of Federal information security.

Up to this point, CDM has not sought to address cloud-hosted systems and
has instead focused on helping agencies secure their on premise
networks. While this does introduce some limitations, the program has
nonetheless elevated the baseline of cybersecurity across the
Government. Over the identified phases, the program will deliver
capabilities through various mechanisms, including an “as-a-service
model,” to ensure that additional capabilities can be provided in a more
centralized and standard way.

A challenge in implementing CDM capabilities in a more cloud-friendly
architecture is that security teams and security operations centers may
not necessarily have the expertise available to defend the updated
architecture. To support agency cybersecurity efforts, the Federal
Government is working to develop this expertise and provide it across
agencies through CDM. Currently, all CFO Act agencies (except the
Department of Defense) participate in CDM, as do 44 of the non-CFO Act
agencies in the Federal enterprise. CDM will continue to grow and
provide sophisticated tools and services to current agencies, while
working to onboard the other small agencies not currently served by the
program.

This is imperative for enabling the Federal Government to increase
security throughout the Federal enterprise. Further targeted actions by
DHS’s CDM Program Office and agencies can help expedite the
modernization and adoption of CDM to identify, detect, and respond to
threats in the Federal Government’s increasing move to cloud
environments and mobile devices.

**Within 60 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS, in partnership with agencies and GSA, will complete the
acquisition strategy for new, long-term task orders to offer CDM
lifecycle support to agencies and provide solution development and
implementation for Phases 3 and 4 in addition to future work,
including cloud security.

**Within 125 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS will leverage all available departmental resources, to the extent
practicable, to obtain an initial ATO for the CDM Group F Platform. If
necessary, DHS will request additional support from OMB, GSA, or other
entities to ensure an efficient authorization, consistent with the
appropriate security posture required of the CDM Program, potential
customer agencies, and the authorizing official. Upon completion of
the authorization process, DHS will begin onboarding agencies onto CDM
to provide continuous monitoring as a service capabilities.

At the end of the 125 days, DHS will update OMB on the current number
and status of remaining Memoranda of Agreement it has established with
non-CFO Act agencies (above and beyond the current number of 44). DHS
will also submit a plan to OMB that details the expectations and
timelines for onboarding non-CFO Act agencies to the CDM Group F
Platform.

**Within 150 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS will complete the data exchanges between the agency- and
Federal-level dashboards to provide enterprise-wide situational
awareness of an agency’s cyber posture.

**Within 180 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS, in partnership with the Federal CIO Council, will implement a
concept of operations for the Federal dashboard to include procedures
to manage cyber risks across the Federal enterprise, and other factors
pertinent to the broader Federal CIO community.

**Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Service**

The Security Operations Center (SOC), which generally provides central
visibility into the state of security on an agency’s networks, is an
essential component of securing the Federal IT enterprise; however, many
agencies lack the resources or expertise to establish their own
agency-level SOCs. Given the vulnerability this creates, the
establishment of a SOC as a service (SOCaaS) capability is essential to
ensure appropriate enterprise-wide visibility, incident discovery, and
information sharing among Federal agencies. Such a capability would
allow agencies currently lacking such capabilities to purchase them from
those agencies with sufficient capacity to offer such a service. This
could allow for the creation of specialized offerings. For instance,
agencies who have demonstrated expertise in defending cloud applications
could expand their current SOC capabilities and offer a SOCaaS, focusing
specifically on cloud applications. In addition, contracts can be
established with commercial providers to provide SOCaaS offerings.
Agencies lacking the requisite expertise could leverage these services
to accelerate their migration to commercial cloud capabilities.

Over time, agencies offering SOCaaS could provide a full suite of
capabilities to agencies that do not want or need to manage their own
operations. This would align with the consolidation of existing
networks. A more consolidated SOC would have broader visibility, easier
communications, and the ability to add tools not available in a more
distributed model.

Specifically, SOC as a Service capabilities could:

-   Prevent security capabilities from causing latency issues;

-   Apply security protections at the application and data levels which
    are commensurate with the sensitivity of the data;

-   Offer capabilities for multiple types of logs or data flows
    depending on cloud provider technology and contract specifications;
    and

-   Allow visibility across multiple agency cloud systems to be
