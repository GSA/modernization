## Summary of Efforts to Date

A model for sharing services already exists within the Federal
Government, allowing for the delivery of common administrative functions
such as financial management, human resources, payroll, and
acquisitions. The concept of shared services was first substantively
addressed by the Federal Government in the early 1980s with the creation
of the National Finance Center within the Department of Agriculture,
which sought to reduce redundancy in the hiring of administrative staff.
The value of sharing was self-evident, and, in the 1990s, a series of
projects to share back-office services were established and made
permanent. In addition, the Federal Government began laying the
foundation to implement category management principles by establishing a
team of dedicated senior Government executives to oversee the 10 largest
areas of federal procurement. Specifically, the IT Category Manager
established several interagency subcategory teams to further streamline
and management of common IT commodities such as hardware, software, and
mobility.

While there has long been interest in shared services for general IT
needs, a perilous threat environment has resulted in a need for
cybersecurity shared services as well as commercially provided
capabilities, such as email and cloud. Not only would the widespread use
and deployment of shared services in information security provide cost
savings, they would also provide a more consistent level of security
across the Federal enterprise.

## Current State

Addressing security challenges is critical if the Federal Government
expects to achieve strong security outcomes; however, the current model
of distributed Federal IT makes tackling complex resource-intensive
problems in a consistent manner challenging. Today, each agency must
independently identify possible vendors, evaluate the security of the
vendors, issue an ATO, integrate the solution into their own independent
bespoke IT infrastructure, and allocate resources to monitor and operate
that infrastructure on an ongoing basis. The combination of these
factors does not achieve consistent high quality security outcomes.

The Federal Government is the world’s largest buyer. There is a critical
need to change the way the Federal Government buys common information
technology products and services. Significant contract duplication means
that agencies award multiple contracts for similar goods and services,
often leading to hundreds, if not thousands, of contracts for the same
requirement with same vendors. Additionally, there are huge price
variance for the exact same item, sometimes as much as 300 - 400
percent. Agencies work highly autonomously, with only occasional
collaboration across organizations and little sharing of information,
standards, and best practices. This degree of fragmentation, lack of
common standards, and lack of coordination drives costly redundancies
and inefficiencies in procurement actions, contracting vehicles, and
customization of common information technology solutions.

The existing federated and distributed approach to IT is no longer
sustainable in an increasingly mobile, cloud-based and complex digital
world. Building or internally operating such security programs requires
specialized cybersecurity talent and knowledge, access to a broad range
of data sources to manage the latest threats, and sophisticated and
costly emulation and static analysis technology. This is an immense
undertaking for large departments, but even more so for smaller and
non-CFO Act agencies who often struggle with basic security functions,
such as vulnerability mitigation, due to resource limitations. Programs
like CDM are taking steps toward deploying common tools across all
agencies and integrating large and small agencies into a shared
cybersecurity understanding; however, many of these programs, including
CDM, have been mired by delays and have not yet yielded their full
promise.

## Future State & Objectives

In order to reduce cost, improve operational efficiencies and
cybersecurity, the Federal Government must shift toward a consolidated
IT model. This includes adopting centralized offerings for non-mission
specific functions by default, and should comprise commodity IT, such as
email, productivity, collaboration, and security tools. This approach is
consistent with ongoing category management practices and will help the
Federal Government rapidly deploy new capabilities that will enhance
agencies’ abilities to perform their missions and secure their networks.
The Federal Government must embrace the broader use of cloud services
while working to develop cloud products that meet Federal cybersecurity
standards. With the proper type of cloud offering designed with an
appropriate focus on security, the increased use and consolidation of IT
services in multi-tenant cloud services can provide the visibility and
control necessary to deploy data-level protections and automated
cybersecurity outlined earlier in this report. Agencies must leverage
shared services and embrace commercial technologies where possible,
building new capabilities only when shared services and commercial
technologies cannot meet mission need.

In order to achieve the desired future state, the Government must
address the current impediments in policy, resource allocation, and
disparate agency interpretations of statutes and guidance, in addition
to other considerations that are obstacles to agencies’ adopting shared
and cloud services. The Government should work with cloud infrastructure
providers to obtain systems that offer world-class levels of
functionality, cost-effectiveness, and security based on the providers’
abilities to aggregate demand across a broad range of customers. Rather
than relying on often outdated and agency-specific systems, the Federal
Government could leverage these providers’ expertise to both save
taxpayer dollars and increase effectiveness and security.

## Implementation Plan

Both the short- and long-term steps outlined in this section will result
in greater innovation across the Federal enterprise, decrease costs, and
dramatically improve services provided to both agencies and citizens.
These interventions will allow agencies, and particularly smaller
agencies, to more easily acquire and adopt commodity cloud
infrastructure products, while leveraging the Federal Government’s
buying power to produce economies of scale. Additionally, these efforts
will augment existing agency-specific technology to improve both
visibility and security. This implementation plan focuses on three key
areas viewed as pivotal for accelerating the move to shared services:
(1) enabling the use of commercial cloud services and infrastructure;
(2) accelerating adoption of cloud email and collaboration tools; and
(3) providing additional and improving existing shared services.

### 1.  Enable the Use of Commercial Cloud Services and Infrastructure

Major commercial cloud infrastructure providers offer excellent levels
of functionality, cost effectiveness, and security because of their
ability to aggregate demand across a broad range of customers. There are
a wide range of ways each of the models outlined below can drive cloud
adoption by Government customers; however, it is generally helpful to
think about the options as one default approach and a second option when
security requirements require it.

-   **"Bring the Government to the Cloud."** This approach is the
    recommended default approach the Government should utilize and is
    characterized by multitenant commercially owned infrastructure
    (e.g., building servers, networks, applications) that is shared with
    other non-Government customers, but in which Government data is
    protected through security technologies and encryption.

-   **“Bring the Cloud to the Government."** This approach is
    characterized by multitenant Government-owned and -operated
    infrastructure (e.g., buildings, servers, networks, applications) or
    commercially owned and operated infrastructure isolated and
    dedicated for Government use.

In order to ensure a smooth adoption of cloud technologies across the
Government, it is important to understand the various models that are
available for utilizing cloud services. The following two options
describe the main approaches in which the Government has adopted cloud
services and how these models could be adjusted moving forward.

#### Bring Government to the Cloud: Vendor-owned and -operated servers and applications — Software as a Service

This is the ubiquitous public cloud model used by the vast majority of
private sector cloud providers, and is already in use by many Federal
agencies today. Among other uses, this model is appropriate for modern
cloud-hosted email, productivity, and collaboration tools. Government
agencies also currently use Software as a Service for a wide variety of
applications like online payroll services, applicant tracking systems
for hiring, and travel booking and expense management systems. These
services are typically accessed through secure connections over the
Internet.

Many agencies have already fully embraced vendor-operated, cloud-based
collaboration tools, and, depending on the agency, may have anywhere
from dozens to hundreds of such tools in use today in their environment.
It is important for the rest of Government to migrate from legacy
offerings to take advantage of the increased productivity and innovation
that these shared services offer.

#### Bring Government to the Cloud: Vendor-owned and operated servers and Government-operated applications with networks that utilize a secure connection — Infrastructure as a Service

Some service needs can only be met by developing custom software, or by
buying software not available as a service. With this model, a cloud
vendor owns and operates servers in a private sector data center, but
connected through a secure connection. Secure connections could include
HTTPS, TLS, peering, etc. This provides an infrastructure upon which
agencies deploy applications that they create or acquire. This model can
be utilized for secure, critical applications that are only available to
Government users on a virtual private network (VPN) or other
network-level isolation.

Because Infrastructure as a Service gives customers control over many
low-level details, it can entirely replace the need for a traditional on
premise data center. Agencies can often move existing services from
legacy on premise data centers to cloud infrastructure with some
software modifications.

These applications can be public services used by the general public or
private internal services used by agency employees. In either case,
agencies may consider cloud infrastructure as a service to be an
extension of their existing private enterprise network, or they may
treat it as a separate, isolated network. Regardless, users access the
service through secure connections, which could include HTTPS, TLS, VPN,
or a dedicated line.

Infrastructure as a service excels at providing a platform for creating
and deploying the digital services that are core to an agency’s mission.
These models are already in use by agencies in a wide range of use
cases, including benefits processing for veterans, immigration, and
healthcare, as well as data processing and software testing in the
Department of Defense community.

#### Bring the Cloud to Government: Government-owned data center buildings with vendor-owned and -operated services

For certain applications where using the Internet is not a viable
option, commercial providers can operate infrastructure in
Government-owned facilities. This is attractive for classified systems,
which cannot be connected to the public Internet. For example, the
intelligence community was the original adopter of a model in which
vendor-owned and operated services were based out of Government-owned
data center buildings. An example of this approach is the Intelligence
Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE) Commercial Cloud
Services.

This model is much more expensive than fully commercial cloud services,
and cannot keep pace with the innovation of public cloud solutions. As
such, it is only appropriate where the Government absolutely must retain
physical control over the infrastructure.

It is important to be wary of on premise solutions that are sold with
cloud terminology that do not actually meet the NIST Essential
Characteristics of cloud computing.[^18] Often, products that claim to
offer private cloud infrastructure fail to deliver on these promises,
missing key aspects such as rapid elasticity, on-demand self-service, or
resource pooling.

#### Bring the Cloud to Government: Vendor-owned and -operated data centers with servers dedicated for Government use**

Many cloud service providers offer Government-dedicated versions of
their services, where the provider builds segregated space for
Government use so that agency customers only share logical space
(possibly including servers, buildings, networks, personnel) with other
Government customers. This allows a provider to more easily meet
Government-specific compliance requirements for securing sensitive data.

This model provides a middle ground between public shared cloud
infrastructure and costly on premise infrastructure. It is used by many
agencies today to house applications where legal, compliance, or
security reasons preclude the use of shared servers.

This model, which is already in use, could be particularly useful and
appropriate for hosting Government websites and services for
infrastructure that may have sensitivities for which public servers
would not be appropriate.

**Recommendations:**

Cloud is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and offers a multitude of
options for agencies based on their needs and preferences. While it is
important to ensure flexibility across the Federal Government, there are
a few models that can cover the majority of Federal use cases. As such,
the Government should invest in two to three cloud models to support the
differing security and risk-tolerance postures of agencies.

In particular, the Government should expand its use of the “Bring the
Government to the Cloud” models, as these best balance the benefits of
cloud computing—including improved performance and cost-savings—with
outsourced security and control. While the impending revisions to the
TIC policy and guidance will affect some of the eventual business
decisions surrounding cloud options, agencies should begin working to
determine how best to use the models outlined above.

Next steps to support the above recommendations are
as follows:

> **Upon Approval of the President and Within a Timeline of 30 Days:**
>
> Pursuant to its statutory authorities and in execution thereof, OMB
> will conduct a data call requesting that agencies identify systems
> that may be ready for cloud migration and can be migrated securely but
> have not yet migrated due to perceived or encountered difficulties. At
> the conclusion of this data call, OMB and GSA will review the
> impediments to moving to the cloud outlined by agencies and will
> prioritize an infusion of technical talent, capital, and updated
> security policy (developed iteratively to solve agency-specific
> issues) as needed to enable prioritized cloud migrations. This task is
> described in more detail in the following section.

> These clauses will ensure uniformity in contract language and provide
> rigor to standard Government terms, which would be particularly
> valuable to agencies lacking relevant technical, legal, or
> acquisitions expertise to craft, out of whole cloth, such language in
> their cloud procurements.

### 2.  Accelerate Adoption of Cloud Email and Collaboration Tools

Email is an essential mechanism for collaboration and one of the most
prevalent attack vectors for cybercrime in modern society. Targeted,
email-based spear phishing attacks using malicious attachments and links
are the primary attack vector for compromising individuals and
organizations.

Accelerated rollout of cloud email and collaboration is urgent given the
number of duplicative legacy systems and their associated cybersecurity
risks. In addition, even within cloud-based email, there exists price
variance due to the fact that agencies negotiate individually. Thus,
consolidating buying power through Government-wide price negotiations
has the potential to achieve further cost savings.

In order to support agencies in moving away from their own email servers
and solutions, a set of secure, easy-to-maintain, and cost-effective
solutions must be available. Industry is well positioned to provide
effective security controls, especially when paired with NCPS
capabilities and to enable agencies to leverage improved mobile, tablet,
and productivity improvements. There are currently only two hosted
solutions deployed in the Federal Government, though additional
competitors could emerge. Regardless, a requirement to make better use
of cloud-based email and collaboration services increases the
Government’s leverage in obtaining better pricing.

While the benefits are worthwhile, ranging from cost savings to improved
security, the migration itself to cloud-based tools can be costly and
burdensome, particularly for smaller agencies. In order to support
agencies in their migration, a set of secure, easy-to-maintain, and
cost-effective solutions must be made available.

The Government must pursue new acquisition tactics for cloud email and
collaboration licenses. In furtherance of this objective, pilots such as
the example outlined in Appendix D may be executed to decrease the
administrative acquisition burden, specifically for smaller agencies who
cannot leverage large volume discounts or who have acquisition workforce
constraints. Additional pilots may include the ability to purchase cloud
services on a consumption basis and coordinated purchasing to obtain
tiered-based pricing.

Successful execution of the pilot outlined in Appendix D will result in
agreements with cloud email providers, which define volume discount
pricing based on the total number of Government-wide mailboxes to be
migrated while preserving the ability for agencies to compete with cloud
email providers. This pilot will help determine what, if any, drawbacks
or complications emerge from the creation of this heretofore untested
model of volume pricing negotiations. This should result in shorter
competitions (one to two months for acquiring cloud email licenses) as
opposed to the months- to years-long process such procurements, such as
establishing Government-wide acquisition contracts or blanket purchase
agreements, currently require.

One of the fundamental advantages the Government has in seeking products
and services is that its size should allow it to leverage competing
market forces to drive Government-wide volume pricing and increase the
overall speed of migration. The goal would be to incentivize providers
through tiered pricing agreements that would produce publicly displayed
price points to serve as the base license price for any licenses
purchased by the Government.

This would mark a significant departure from existing acquisition
marketplaces where existing models are laborious for both Government and
industry and fail to truly capture volume spending as an aggregated
value. In addition, the current process does not always offer sufficient
transparency, allowing some agencies to pay less than others. Often, it
is the small agencies, who can least afford higher prices, that are
penalized.

Next steps to support the above recommendations are as follows:

> **Upon Approval of the President and within a Timeline of 30 Days:**
>
> OMB will conduct a data call to agencies regarding their current email
> contracts, prices, and number of mailboxes. It is imperative that the
> Government obtain an accurate measurement of the market size of
> agencies who have not yet migrated to cloud email. While there are
> clear data on the current need among CFO Act agencies, there is
> currently no definitive data regarding the adoption of cloud-based
> email solutions at small and independent agencies. Understanding the
> full size of the marketplace will enable the Government to maximize
> its leverage in negotiations with cloud collaboration vendors.
>
> OMB will convene a task force of agencies to finalize a standard set
> of requirements for cloud email, including both low and moderate
> security postures for email and cloud collaboration. These
> requirements, which will build upon previously completed work, will be
> circulated to all agencies for comment and serve as the basis for
> acquisition.
>
> **Upon Approval of the President and within a Timeline of 45 Days:**
>
> OMB will issue updated identity policy guidance for public comment
> that will reduce agency burden and recommend identity service areas
> suitable for shared services. GSA will provide a business case to the
> Federal CIO on the consolidation of existing identity services to
> improve usability and drive secure access and interoperability. This
> action will enable secure access and collaboration as a service in a
> way that improves existing agency-specific implementations, which
> often have various levels of security and do not include
> interoperability.
>
> **Upon Approval of the President and within a Timeline of 60 Days:**
>
> OMB will establish a comprehensive strategy for driving the
> accelerated migration of agency email and collaboration tools to the
> cloud for departments and agencies who have still not adopted
> cloud-based email. This strategy should emphasize achieving both cost
> savings and improved security.
>
> **Upon Approval of the President and within a Timeline of 90 Days:**
>
> OMB will assemble an Acquisition Tiger Team (ATT), which will be
> charged with drafting and disseminating a “quick start” acquisition
> package that can help agencies facilitate rapid license and migration

> licenses and services that may presently have difficulty doing so. The
> “quick start” package would include market research, acquisition
> plans, templates for requesting quotes, identified sources of supply,
> and Independent Government Cost Estimate calculation templates (based

>
> The ATT, working through the appropriate executive agent, will send
> out Requests for Information (RFIs) or conduct other market research
> activities to find qualified small business and socio-economic
> concerns to leverage set aside programs and other authorities to
> streamline the migration acquisitions to the greatest extent possible.
> For example, using the 8(a) Digital Service Initiative or vehicles

>
> **Upon Approval of the President and within a Timeline of 180 Days:**
>
> The Government should consider incentives for early adoption

>
> **Other High-Level Actions:**
>
> Approved FISMA-Moderate cloud based collaboration tools currently
> exist. GSA will continue to work with existing cloud email and
> collaboration providers, and will prioritize approval of a FISMA-High
> offering. Process improvements will continue iteratively to enable
> agencies to accelerate adoption of cloud services.

### 3.  Improve Existing and Provide Additional Security Shared Services

As cyberattacks have become more sophisticated, frequent, and easier for
adversaries to execute, cybersecurity has continued to escalate as a
primary responsibility for all individual agencies and for the Federal
Government as a whole. Addressing cybersecurity threats holistically
necessitates both a further consolidation of the Federal Government’s IT
footprint as well as an expansion of shared, centralized services to
better leverage Federal buying power, standardize security capabilities,
improve the time it takes to detect and respond to incidents, and
realize economies of scale from aggregating data.

**Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM)**

DHS established the CDM Program in 2013 to provide Federal civilian
agencies with automated continuous monitoring tools to detect
vulnerabilities and potentially malicious network activity in near
real-time.[^21]^,^ [^22] CDM Phase 1, which is currently being deployed,
is designed to determine “what is on the network” by providing agencies
with capabilities to identify and remediate vulnerabilities and ensure
secure hardware and software configurations on their networks. CDM Phase
2 will focus on “who is on the network” and provide capabilities to
detect and manage privileged user access and ensure that only
authorized, credentialed users have access to information on the
network. CDM Phase 3 will report “what is happening on the network” and
provide capabilities to identify and assess anomalies that may indicate
a cybersecurity compromise and to implement ongoing assessment and
authorization. CDM Phase 4 will focus on expanding data protections for
Government information. All CDM capabilities will feed information to
both an agency- and Federal-level dashboard, enabling Government-wide
visibility into the current state of Federal information security.

Up to this point, CDM has not sought to address cloud-hosted systems and
has instead focused on helping agencies secure their on premise
networks. While this does introduce some limitations, the program has
nonetheless elevated the baseline of cybersecurity across the
Government. Over the identified phases, the program will deliver
capabilities through various mechanisms, including an “as-a-service
model,” to ensure that additional capabilities can be provided in a more
centralized and standard way.

A challenge in implementing CDM capabilities in a more cloud-friendly
architecture is that security teams and security operations centers may
not necessarily have the expertise available to defend the updated
architecture. To support agency cybersecurity efforts, the Federal
Government is working to develop this expertise and provide it across
agencies through CDM. Currently, all CFO Act agencies (except the
Department of Defense) participate in CDM, as do 44 of non-CFO Act
agencies in the Federal enterprise. CDM will continue to grow and
provide sophisticated tools and services to current agencies, while
working to onboard the other small agencies not currently served by the
program.

This is imperative for enabling the Federal Government to increase
security throughout the Federal enterprise. Further targeted actions by
DHS’s CDM Program Office and agencies can help expedite the
modernization and adoption of CDM to identify, detect, and respond to
threats in the Federal Government’s increasing move to cloud
environments and mobile devices.

#### Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Service

The Security Operations Center (SOC), which generally provides central
visibility into the state of security on an agency’s networks, is an
essential component of securing the Federal IT enterprise; however, many
agencies lack the resources or expertise to establish their own
agency-level SOCs. Given the vulnerability this creates, the
establishment of a SOC as a service (SOCaaS) capability is essential to
ensure appropriate enterprise-wide visibility, incident discovery, and
information sharing among Federal agencies. Such a capability would
allow agencies currently lacking such capabilities to purchase them from
those agencies with sufficient capacity to offer such a service. This
could allow for the creation of specialized offerings. For instance,
agencies who have demonstrated expertise in defending cloud applications
could expand their current SOC capabilities and offer a SOCaaS, focusing
specifically on cloud applications. In addition, contracts can be let
with commercial providers to provide SOCaaS offerings. Agencies lacking
the requisite expertise could leverage these services to accelerate
their migration to commercial cloud capabilities.

Over time, agencies offering SOCaaS could provide a full suite of
capabilities to agencies that do not want or need to manage their own
operations. This would align with the consolidation of existing
networks. A more consolidated SOC would have broader visibility, easier
communications, and the ability to add tools not available in a more
distributed model.

Specifically, SOC as a Service capabilities could:

-   Prevent security capabilities from causing latency issues;

-   Apply security protections at the application and data levels which
    are commensurate with the sensitivity of the data;

-   Offer capabilities for multiple types of logs or data flows
    depending on cloud provider technology and contract specifications;
    and

-   Allow visibility across multiple agency cloud systems to be
    aggregated and managed centrally.

> **Upon Approval of the President and within a Timeline of 60 Days:**
>

>
> **Upon Approval of the President and within a Timeline of 90 Days:**
