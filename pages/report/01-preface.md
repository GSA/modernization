The United States is unparalleled in its commitment to protecting
Americans’ liberties and freedoms and is unmatched in its national
security infrastructure. Hardworking Americans have built the world’s
largest economy and solved some of the world’s greatest challenges
through innovations in science and technology. It is imperative for the
Federal Government to leverage these innovations to provide better
service for its citizens in the most cost-effective and secure manner.
This Administration has prioritized modernization of Federal information
technology (IT) systems, and to that end, has committed to help agencies
better leverage American innovations through increased use of commercial
technology.

As a demonstration of this commitment, on May 1, 2017, the President
[established the American Technology Council][1] (ATC) to effectuate the
secure and efficient use of IT across the Federal Government. Just
days later, on May 11, 2017, the President signed Executive Order (EO)
13800, [*Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure*][EO13800]. The latter EO tasks the Director of ATC to
coordinate a report to the President from the Secretary of the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), and the Administrator of the General
Services Administration (GSA), in consultation with the Secretary of
Commerce (Commerce), regarding the modernization of Federal IT.

Acknowledging that Federal agencies are still working, and must continue
to work, to meet the objectives of other critical modernization
initiatives – for instance, by automating their manual processes,
implementing new and diverse testing and scanning options, deploying
patches both responsively and preventatively, and by transitioning away
from unsupported software – this report outlines the current and
envisioned state of Federal IT, and it provides specific recommendations
to jumpstart a new wave of modernization efforts.

This report is focused on modernization efforts to improve the security
posture of Federal IT. Though this covers a significant footprint of
modernization needs, the public comment period generated responses from
industry that highlighted the importance of providing an overarching IT
modernization plan, which aligns these efforts with ongoing work to
improve citizen-facing services, make better use of mobile technologies,
improving security across the Federal enterprise, and other key efforts.
In response to this, the American Technology Council will provide this
amplifying context following publication of this final report.

The enclosed plan incorporates the efforts of key Government
stakeholders in identifying ways for the Government to enhance its
cybersecurity posture, modernize the Federal IT enterprise, and create a
more robust partnership between Government and industry. Additionally,
the ATC has convened top private and public sector leaders to elicit and
incorporate input on the vision for the future of Federal IT, and it
intends to seek further input to ensure successful implementation of
modernization recommendations.
