title: "Appendix D: Acquisition Pilot: Change the Buying Strategy to
Government-As-One-Purchaser"
permalink: /report/appendices/acquisition-pilot/
---
The Government must pursue new acquisition strategies for cloud email
and collaboration licenses. In furtherance of this objective, pilots
such as the example outlined in this Appendix may be executed to
decrease the administrative acquisition burden, specifically for smaller
agencies who cannot leverage large volume discounts or who have
acquisition workforce constraints. Additional pilots to leverage the
Government as one purchaser and speed cloud adoption may include the
ability to purchase cloud services on a consumption basis and
coordinated purchasing to obtain tiered-based pricing.

Several challenges must be overcome in the acquisition cycle in order to
comply with [EO 13800][EO13800] and facilitate shared services, such as cloud
email. Budgets are constrained by yearly appropriations, and agencies
work autonomously, which reduces the Government’s ability to look at its
purchasing as a whole. Legacy procurement and security regulations,
coupled with lack of top down guidance for the logistics of a
Government-wide migration to cloud email challenge cloud adoption.

By creating virtual “street corners” for cloud email providers the
Federal Government can use competing market forces to drive
Government-wide volume pricing as a lever to speed migration. This will
apply Hotelling’s Law of spatial competition, wherein Government’s
potential purchasing power will be used to negotiate tiered pricing
agreements directly with the providers and result in publicly displayed
price points, total number of licenses purchased, and the remaining
number of mailboxes that need to be migrated. This volume pricing would
serve as the base rate for any license purchased by the Government.

### Public Dashboard Example (Cloud-Based E-mail)\*

In this scenario, data would be recorded and displayed publicly with the
current negotiated pricing tiers, along with any incentive pricing based
on other factors such as the company’s quarterly sales cycles.

| **Cloud Email Provider A**       | **Quarter/ Price per user/month** |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Tier 1: 1 – 5,000 licenses       | Q1-3: 2% discount                 |
|                                  | Q4: 2.5% discount                 |
| Tier 2: 5,000 – 10,000 licenses  | Q1-3 2.7% discount                |
|                                  | Q4: 3.0%                          |
| Tier 3: 10,000 – 50,000 licenses | Q 1-4: 3.2%                       |

*\*These numbers are fabricated for this example only.*

A running total of the licenses purchased would be displayed so that at
any time, end users would know the price point. This would be validated
with the companies for the official count.

*Publicly Displayed Information Example:*

**As of 6/29/17 Total Licenses purchased Government-wide: 1,345,000**

Pricing Level= Tier 3, Q2 = \$3.2% discount per user/month

**Total mailboxes to migrate:** 3,000,000

The objectives and expected outcomes would include a more constructive
and mutually-beneficial ecosystem with private sector companies, better
and more transparent pricing for Government agencies, and an increased
variety of available secure solutions. This would also lead to more
consistent implementation and configurations across the Federal
enterprise. Lastly, this would incentivize agencies with smaller budgets
to adopt cloud email earlier.

#### Assumptions

This assessment relies on the following assumptions:

-   Industry and private sector companies are not only willing to come
    to the table, but to actually collaborate with the Federal
    Government in pursuing this new approach to contracting;

-   Industry must be willing to negotiate fair and reasonable tiered
    volume pricing that will be made public. Departments, agencies, and
    industry must agree on metrics and public reporting and tracking of
    agency adoption of cloud email adoption;

-   Agencies must also be active in timely reporting of their data,
    which will be displayed publicly, in order to ensure as specific
    volumes are reached, discounts are provided;

-   The Government has the ability to negotiate a Manufacturer’s
    Agreement that will be accepted by agencies; and

-   This approach is platform agnostic, any cloud-based email provider
    may be eligible to participate; agencies will still need to follow
    competition rules as required to place orders.

#### Why This Works

A common strategy for many chains is to locate near a competitor. For
example, you will almost always see a CVS near a Walgreens or a Burger
King near a McDonalds. You will see food chains across the street or
next to each other in almost any city in the United States. The thinking
is that if it works for the competitor, it will likely work for you.
Studies have shown repeatedly that as chains sprout up in adjacency,
volume also goes up. This strategy is commonly known as the Nash
Equilibrium, a solution concept of non-cooperative competition involving
two or more “players,” where each player knows the equilibrium
strategies of the others and no one has anything to gain by changing
their own strategy.

*Creating the Marketplace with Hotelling’s Law:* In simple terms,
Hotelling’s Law determines that businesses selling similar products tend
to locate as close as possible in order to maintain the maximum amount
of market share possible. Creating a public display and accountability
to the total Government spend for the different types of cloud email and
the number of mailboxes left to be migrated will create this
marketplace.

This strategy also takes into account that re-sellers would still be
able to sell these licenses under existing GSA Schedules and
Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), or NASA SEWP contracts;
however, they would be required to use the current price point, record
the sale into the dashboard, and make their re-seller fees transparent
to Government as the differentiation in competition. Ultimately, this
will save business development and contract negotiation time and effort
between the email providers and the re-sellers, which will drive down
the overhead fees the Government has to pay.

Services, configurations, and prices all negotiated openly and reported
publicly will not only ensure the most competitive rates for Government,
but also create an optimal strategy for the vendors themselves. This
dis-incentivizes vendors from focusing on the highest possible price
point for their services and, instead, refocuses the competition on
performance and quality of the offerings as a distinguishing factor.

### Pilot to Test the Hypothesis

The steps outlined below would be used to test the theory that this
would change the way we buy these services and establish a shared
service approach to license purchasing. This is not the full
implementation plan which will provide more details for how and when
these general steps will be accomplished. The implementation plan will
address pilot success criteria to include input and feedback from
agencies and industry which may change the course of the outcome.

**Get Industry Buy-in and Feedback.** Capitalizing on the recent success
of the IT CEO Summit, the Office of American Innovation will call a
follow-up summit with interested cloud providers to discuss the
proposal. The goal would be to determine whether CSPs would be willing
to participate in a pilot with the Federal Government.

**Measure the Market.** A prerequisite to all other actions is to obtain
an accurate measurement of the market need in terms of agencies that
have not yet transitioned to cloud email solutions. While we have clear
data on implementation among the CFO Act agencies, currently there is no
definitive data source of small and independent agencies adoption of
cloud email. In order to negotiate effectively, knowing the size of the
market is imperative, therefore we need a data call to all agencies
regarding their current email contracts, prices, and number of
mailboxes, etc.

**Establish Focused Pilots with Partners.** ATC and OMB will work with a
small group of agencies to establish a pilot program to examine the
impact of the process changes being proposed. Additionally, they will
lead the creation of a series of support groups that would deploy to
agencies to provide technical, acquisition, and migration assistance and
report to ATC on the progress of the pilots. This will include a
strategy to minimize the burden on early adopters, potentially through
price redetermination terms, modular contracting methods, or
collaborative purchase agreements.

**Create a Reporting Mechanism with Agencies and Industry.** The Federal
Government requires that accurate and up-to-date data around the current
state of both cloud and on-premises email adoption be reported by
agencies so as to develop a baseline against which agency progress may
be tracked. Industry sign-off on transparent reporting of units and
volume pricing is essential to the success of this proposal. Without it,
this strategy will ultimately fail. This is the foundation for achieving
Nash Equilibrium for both the Federal Government and industry.

### Notional Metrics of Success

-   At least one cloud-based email service provider has signed up to
    negotiate a memorandum of understanding within 90 days of the report
    being published, which would allow the Government to begin capturing
    FY 2018 spending on cloud email migrations;

-   At least two agencies have signed on to pilot the proposed dashboard
    and provide reporting and acquisition of cloud email licenses under
    this effort; and

-   Within 30 days of qualified purchases, agencies or re-sellers will
    record the sale in the dashboard.
