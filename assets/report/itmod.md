**Appendix D: Acquisition Pilot: Change the Buying Strategy to
Government-As-One-Purchaser**

The Government must pursue new acquisition strategies for cloud email
and collaboration licenses. In furtherance of this objective, pilots
such as the example outlined in this Appendix may be executed to
decrease the administrative acquisition burden, specifically for smaller
agencies who cannot leverage large volume discounts or who have
acquisition workforce constraints. Additional pilots to leverage the
Government as one purchaser and speed cloud adoption may include the
ability to purchase cloud services on a consumption basis and
coordinated purchasing to obtain tiered-based pricing.

Several challenges must be overcome in the acquisition cycle in order to
comply with EO 13800 and facilitate shared services, such as cloud
email. Budgets are constrained by yearly appropriations, and agencies
work autonomously, which reduces the Government’s ability to look at its
purchasing as a whole. Legacy procurement and security regulations,
coupled with lack of top down guidance for the logistics of a
Government-wide migration to cloud email challenge cloud adoption.

By creating virtual “street corners” for cloud email providers the
Federal Government can use competing market forces to drive
Government-wide volume pricing as a lever to speed migration. This will
apply Hotelling’s Law of spatial competition, wherein Government’s
potential purchasing power will be used to negotiate tiered pricing
agreements directly with the providers and result in publicly displayed
price points, total number of licenses purchased, and the remaining
number of mailboxes that need to be migrated. This volume pricing would
serve as the base rate for any license purchased by the Government.

Public Dashboard Example (Cloud-Based E-mail)\*

In this scenario, data would be recorded and displayed publicly with the
current negotiated pricing tiers, along with any incentive pricing based
on other factors such as the company’s quarterly sales cycles.

  ---------------------------------- -------------------------------
  Cloud Email Provider A             Quarter/ Price per user/month
  Tier 1: 1-5,000 licenses           Q1-3: 2% discount
                                     Q4: 2.5% discount
  Tier 2: 5,000– 10,000 licenses     Q1-3 2.7% discount
                                     Q4: 3.0%
  Tier 3: 10,000 – 50,000 licenses   Q 1-4: 3.2%
  ---------------------------------- -------------------------------

*\*These numbers are fabricated for this example only.*

A running total of the licenses purchased would be displayed so that at
any time, end users would know the price point. This would be validated
with the companies for the official count.

*Publicly Displayed Information Example:*

**As of 6/29/17 Total Licenses purchased Government-wide: 1,345,000**

Pricing Level= Tier 3, Q2 = \$3.2% discount per user/month

**Total mailboxes to migrate:** 3,000,000

The objectives and expected outcomes would include a more constructive
and mutually-beneficial ecosystem with private sector companies, better
and more transparent pricing for Government agencies, and an increased
variety of available secure solutions. This would also lead to more
consistent implementation and configurations across the Federal
enterprise. Lastly, this would incentivize agencies with smaller budgets
to adopt cloud email earlier.

***Assumptions***

This assessment relies on the following assumptions:

-   Industry and private sector companies are not only willing to come
    to the table, but to actually collaborate with the Federal
    Government in pursuing this new approach to contracting;

-   Industry must be willing to negotiate fair and reasonable tiered
    volume pricing that will be made public. Departments, agencies, and
    industry must agree on metrics and public reporting and tracking of
    agency adoption of cloud email adoption;

-   Agencies must also be active in timely reporting of their data,
    which will be displayed publicly, in order to ensure as specific
    volumes are reached, discounts are provided;

-   The Government has the ability to negotiate a Manufacturer’s
    Agreement that will be accepted by agencies; and

-   This approach is platform agnostic, any cloud-based email provider
    may be eligible to participate; agencies will still need to follow
    competition rules as required to place orders.

***Why This Works***

A common strategy for many chains is to locate near a competitor. For
example, you will almost always see a CVS near a Walgreens or a Burger
King near a McDonalds. You will see food chains across the street or
next to each other in almost any city in the United States. The thinking
is that if it works for the competitor, it will likely work for you.
Studies have shown repeatedly that as chains sprout up in adjacency,
volume also goes up. This strategy is commonly known as the Nash
Equilibrium, a solution concept of non-cooperative competition involving
two or more “players,” where each player knows the equilibrium
strategies of the others and no one has anything to gain by changing
their own strategy.

*Creating the Marketplace with Hotelling’s Law:* In simple terms,
Hotelling’s Law determines that businesses selling similar products tend
to locate as close as possible in order to maintain the maximum amount
of market share possible. Creating a public display and accountability
to the total Government spend for the different types of cloud email and
the number of mailboxes left to be migrated will create this
marketplace.

This strategy also takes into account that re-sellers would still be
able to sell these licenses under existing GSA Schedules and
Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), or NASA SEWP contracts;
however, they would be required to use the current price point, record
the sale into the dashboard, and make their re-seller fees transparent
to Government as the differentiation in competition. Ultimately, this
will save business development and contract negotiation time and effort
between the email providers and the re-sellers, which will drive down
the overhead fees the Government has to pay.

Services, configurations, and prices all negotiated openly and reported
publicly will not only ensure the most competitive rates for Government,
but also create an optimal strategy for the vendors themselves. This
dis-incentivizes vendors from focusing on the highest possible price
point for their services and, instead, refocuses the competition on
performance and quality of the offerings as a distinguishing factor.

Pilot to Test the Hypothesis

The steps outlined below would be used to test the theory that this
would change the way we buy these services and establish a shared
service approach to license purchasing. This is not the full
implementation plan which will provide more details for how and when
these general steps will be accomplished. The implementation plan will
address pilot success criteria to include input and feedback from
agencies and industry which may change the course of the outcome.

**Get Industry Buy-in and Feedback.** Capitalizing on the recent success
of the IT CEO Summit, the Office of American Innovation will call a
follow-up summit with interested cloud providers to discuss the
proposal. The goal would be to determine whether CSPs would be willing
to participate in a pilot with the Federal Government.

**Measure the Market.** A prerequisite to all other actions is to obtain
an accurate measurement of the market need in terms of agencies that
have not yet transitioned to cloud email solutions. While we have clear
data on implementation among the CFO Act agencies, currently there is no
definitive data source of small and independent agencies adoption of
cloud email. In order to negotiate effectively, knowing the size of the
market is imperative, therefore we need a data call to all agencies
regarding their current email contracts, prices, and number of
mailboxes, etc.

**Establish Focused Pilots with Partners.** ATC and OMB will work with a
small group of agencies to establish a pilot program to examine the
impact of the process changes being proposed. Additionally, they will
lead the creation of a series of support groups that would deploy to
agencies to provide technical, acquisition, and migration assistance and
report to ATC on the progress of the pilots. This will include a
strategy to minimize the burden on early adopters, potentially through
price redetermination terms, modular contracting methods, or
collaborative purchase agreements.

**Create a Reporting Mechanism with Agencies and Industry.** The Federal
Government requires that accurate and up-to-date data around the current
state of both cloud and on-premises email adoption be reported by
agencies so as to develop a baseline against which agency progress may
be tracked. Industry sign-off on transparent reporting of units and
volume pricing is essential to the success of this proposal. Without it,
this strategy will ultimately fail. This is the foundation for achieving
Nash Equilibrium for both the Federal Government and industry.

Notional Metrics of Success

-   At least one cloud-based email service provider has signed up to
    negotiate a memorandum of understanding within 90 days of the report
    being published, which would allow the Government to begin capturing
    FY 2018 spending on cloud email migrations;

-   At least two agencies have signed on to pilot the proposed dashboard
    and provide reporting and acquisition of cloud email licenses under
    this effort; and

-   Within 30 days of qualified purchases, agencies or re-sellers will
    record the sale in the dashboard.

**Appendix E: Legal Considerations**

**Introduction**

Executive Order 13800, *Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal
Networks and Critical Infrastructure* requires this report to “describe
the legal . . . considerations . . . relevant to . . .” transitioning
agencies to consolidated network infrastructures or shared services.
Exec. Order No. 13,800, 82 FR 22391, § 1(c)(vi)(B)(2) (May 11, 2017).
This appendix, along with the report itself, does so. The report
suggests increased use of consolidated network architectures and shared
services. Generally, Federal law contemplates that agencies control
their own systems and information either directly or through contract.
Moving to consolidated network architectures, commercial cloud and
shared services generally involves moving away from agency control and
thus tends to increase tension with relevant law and requires greater
analysis and legal documentation. While additional legal review and
documentation would need to be performed during any eventual development
of the consolidated network architectures, commercial cloud, and shared
services based on their exact facts, implementation of the report’s
recommendations can likely be achieved within existing law in most
instances, as long as they are designed with a view toward satisfying
applicable legal requirements. A summary of some of the main areas of
law and legal issues implicated by this report are discussed below.

**The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)**

The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) and
later amendments are codified in subsection II of chapter 35 of title 44
of the U.S. Code. These provisions, which we will refer to here as
FISMA, create a whole-of-Government approach to Federal information
security[^32] pursuant to which OMB oversees agency information security
policies and practices; DHS administers implementation of these policies
and practices for Federal, civilian, executive-branch agencies,
including by assisting agencies and providing certain Government-wide
protections; and agencies are responsible for providing information
security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the
potential harm to their agency information and information systems.
*See* 44 U.S.C. §§ 3551-3558. FISMA also requires agencies to implement
a minimum set of information security controls and techniques, assess
the effectiveness of these controls, comply with NIST standards, DHS
directives, and OMB policies, and report certain cybersecurity
information to DHS, OMB and to Congress. The consolidated network
architectures, commercial cloud, and shared services recommended in this
report will need to provide levels of security and transparency that
enable agency heads to ensure compliance with FISMA and its related
requirements, while also providing technical solutions that fit the
needs of multiple agencies.

**The Homeland Security Act’s Federal Intrusion Detection and Prevention
System**

The Homeland Security Act, as amended, requires DHS to “deploy, operate,
and maintain” and “make available for use by any agency” capabilities to
detect cybersecurity risks in agency network traffic and take actions to
mitigate those risks. 6 U.S.C. § 151(b)(1). DHS currently provides these
capabilities through its EINSTEIN program and, as required by law,
ensures all retention, use, and disclosure of information obtained
through EINSTEIN occurs only for the purpose of protecting information
and information systems from cybersecurity risks. *See id*. § 151(c)(3).
Federal law also requires agencies to apply these capabilities to “all
information traveling between an agency information system and any
information system other than an agency information system.” *Id.*
§ 151, note. Because this statutory mandate defines “agency information
system” as any “system owned or operated by an agency,” the statutory
mandate itself does not always require agencies to apply those
capabilities to systems operated by contractors. But existing policy
requires broader application of EINSTEIN, and DHS and agencies can
choose to apply the capabilities to contractor-operated systems.

**Privacy Statutes**

There are many provisions of law and regulation that that protect
personally identifiable information by, for example, limiting access.
*See, e.g.*, U.S. Const. amend IV; Fed. R. Crim. Pro. 6(e)(2)(B) (grand
jury confidentiality rule); 5 U.S.C. § 552a (Privacy Act of 1974); 26
U.S.C. § 6103 (restrictions on access to tax return information); 13
U.S.C. § 9(a) (Census confidentiality statute); 18 U.S.C. § 2511
(Wiretap Act); 6 U.S.C. § 151 (DHS’s Federal Intrusion Detection and
Prevention System). Personnel operating consolidated network
architectures, commercial cloud, and shared services described in this
report will sometimes require access to such information. Technical
capabilities and administrative processes will need to be developed to
enable compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to each type
of information. This will require a significant role for SAOPs and
agency privacy programs.

**Request for Information from Third Parties**

Agencies receive requests for information in their possession through
various means, including, for example, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
requests, Privacy Act requests, congressional requests, Government
Accountability Office audits, Inspector General inquiries, court
proceedings, requests from the White House or other agencies, and other
legal process. Legal agreements between shared service providers and
client agencies will be required to define who will be responsible for
responding to such requests when the information resides in a shared
service in a way that satisfies legal requirements and provides agencies
with sufficient control over their own information. Likewise, agency
notices and regulations should adequately inform the public and others
who might make requests of the appropriate procedures for accessing
information.

**The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)**

The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)
increases the authority of agency Chief Information Officers to play a
significant role in the planning, programming, budgeting, management,
governance and oversight of Federal information technology. 40 U.S.C. §
11319(b)(1)(A). FITARA is consistent with a move toward consolidated
network architectures, commercial cloud, and shared services and
enhances the legal authority for agency CIOs move in that direction.
Among other actions, FITARA and associated policy require agencies to
implement data center consolidation strategies that support (i) movement
of information technology infrastructure to the as-a-service model and
(ii) transition to the cloud. *See* 44 U.S.C. § 3601, note.

**Procurement and Fiscal Considerations**

Transitioning to consolidated network architectures and shared services
requires consideration of how those products or services will be
acquired and funded. In order to consolidate and share services with
each other, Federal agencies will need to enter into Interagency
Agreements or other appropriate agreements with each other that outline
the parameters of their relationship and the applicable authorities that
govern, for example, the acquisition of the products or services, how
they will be shared and utilized by the parties, and how they will be
funded and reimbursed. The specific authorities may vary depending on
the circumstances and agencies affected, but may include:

-   The Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535, which authorizes Federal agencies
    to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from
    another Federal agency and requires full reimbursement.

-   Agency-specific authorities. For example, 40 U.S.C. § 501 authorized
    GSA to procure and supply property and services for executive
    agencies. The funding source utilized in conjunction with 40
    U.S.C. § 501 will depend on which office within GSA is providing
    the property and services, but may include the Acquisition
    Services Fund (40 U.S.C. § 321), a Working Capital Fund, or other
    specific authorities. In general, full reimbursement will be
    required unless specifically authorized otherwise. In an example
    of such a specific authorization, 44 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(6)(B)
    authorizes DHS to “upon request by an agency, deploy\[\],
    operate\[\], and maintain\[\] technology to assist the agency to
    continuously diagnose and mitigate against cyber threats and
    vulnerabilities, with or without reimbursement.”

**Appendix G: Summary of Comments Received**

More than 100 companies and individuals submitted comments during the
three week public comment period for the IT Modernization Report.
Overall, the comments reaffirmed the importance of modernizing Federal
IT, and validated that the proposed approach is on the right track. The
comments offered diverse and at times conflicting suggestions, and
ranged from strategic thoughts to detailed implementation guidance.

The ATC strove to keep this report at a strategic level, and will make
the more detailed ‘implementation level’ comments available to the teams
who will drive specific modernization efforts across Federal IT. Several
comments also noted the need to fundamentally reform or tweak current
statutory provisions, and the ATC will provide these recommendations to
existing activities which are already charged with these statutory
reform areas.

All comments received are publically posted, but this appendix will
highlight some of the key themes that emerged during the comment review.

**Need for technical diversity and efficiency**

Many comments stressed the need to future-proof the Government’s
systems, keep pace with innovation and future standards, maintain vendor
and technology neutrality, and recognize the validity of diverse
approaches to securing data, applications, networks, and services.
Comments also suggested adopting modern approaches to development and
operations such as DevOps and continuous delivery and automate more of
the functional/security testing, integration, deployment, and operations
of applications.

**Accreditation and cybersecurity**

Comments emphasized the benefits of leveraging FedRAMP authorization,
suggested improvements to the FedRAMP process, asserted need to enforce
reciprocity, suggested utilizing the native security capabilities (such
as machine learning and big data analytics) offered by the cloud service
providers, and potential for automating the sharing of classified threat
intelligence with cleared service providers.

**Network modernization and data level security**

Comments emphasized the importance of network level security, advised
that tools should focus on outcomes not mechanisms, that controls must
be placed in closer proximity to the data, and that users, cloud APIs,
and individual devices need to be considered as access control shifts
from the network perimeter. Comments also emphasized that controls must
be placed in closer proximity to the data, and that cloud access
security brokers (CASBs) should be used to provide secure access to
cloud resources.

**Acquisition strategy and workforce **

Several comments indicated concern over halting or pausing acquisitions
in progress, the need for reform of the acquisition and budgeting
processes, and observations that acquisition cycles needed to become
more rapid and agile. Comments also suggested that the acquisition of
modern IT requires a holistic approach (technical, cybersecurity, and
contracting) supported by a trained and experienced workforce.

**Shared services and the acquisition pilot**

Comments suggested that the discussion and policy around shared service
be clarified. Several comments mentioned that contract consolidation on
EIS was essential, while others mentioned that the strategy might stifle
innovation and competition. The ATC is committed to the strategy of
leveraging the competitively awarded EIS contract to assist with
consolidation efforts. Comments suggested that the acquisition pilot
would be useful in proving out the Government’s objectives, while others
suggested it too narrowly scoped. Comments also recommended that
specific vendor names be removed from the notional examples in the
appendix.

Examples of key points derived from the comments is included in the
section below.

**Question 1 - What are major attributes that are missing from the
targeted vision? (Appendix A, Appendix B)**

Comments, in response to this question suggested the report should:

> \(i) make clear the section only described some of the approaches to be
> used;
>
> \(ii) include the concept of logical vice physical separation of data;
>
> \(iii) consider including multi-factor authentication;
>
> \(iv) consider including the concept of least privilege;
>
> \(v) consider expanding the discussion regarding software lifecycle
> automation and security testing.

Many of the comments confirmed that the attributes were on the right
track or offered additional suggestions and insights to attributes
proffered within the report.

**Question 2 - What are major attributes that should not be included in
the targeted vision?**

Comments, in response to this question, suggested the report should:

> \(i) remove references to specific companies;
>
> \(ii) remove or revise the suggestion that agencies halt procurement
> actions that are underway;
>
> \(iii) expand the description and approaches to cybersecurity assessment
> and authorization.

Many of the comments confirmed that the attributes were on the right
track or offered additional suggestions and insights to attributes
proffered within the report.

**Question 3 - Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for
implementing network modernization & consolidation? **

**Question 4 - Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for
implementing shared services to enable future network architectures? **

Comments and recommendations in response to questions 3 and 4 were
similar and suggested or implied that the report:

> \(i) should clarify the definition, description, and/or purpose of
> employing shared services;
>
> \(ii) should identify and address obstacles to adopting shared services
> or network consolidation;
>
> \(iii) should, relative to item (ii) recommend that a greater focus and
> actions be placed on addressing issues relative to the FAR;
>
> \(iv) should acknowledge need to reuse existing accreditation packages
> (aka foster reciprocity among agencies);
>
> \(v) relative to item (iv) above, should suggest an activity to improve
> reciprocity and identify capabilities to automate NIST RMF Framework;
>
> \(vi) reinforce the need for training and career development for
> professionals involved in accomplishing the goals articulated in the
> report.

Many of the comments confirmed that the tasks were appropriate and/or
offered additional enhancement to the identified tasks.

**Question 5 What is the feasibility of the proposed acquisition pilot?
(Appendix D)**

Comments, in response to this question, suggested that the report:

> \(i) should clarify the intent, purpose, scope, expected outcomes, and
> assessment criteria of-and-for the pilot;
>
> \(ii) should consider expanding the pilot to other shared services;
>
> \(iii) should de-identify service providers and include contracting
> options.

The comments generally confirmed that a pilot was a valid idea and
offered additional suggestions, approaches, and identified potential
pit-falls.

We want to express appreciation for the sincerity, depth of thought, and
time taken by each of the commenters and encourage the community to go
to the public website and read each of the submissions.
