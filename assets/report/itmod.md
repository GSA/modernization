**Shared Services to Enable Future Network Architectures**
==========================================================

**Summary of Efforts to Date **

Category Management and Shared Services are both industry leading
practices that help the Federal Government deliver common functions in a
more effective and efficient way. Category Management allows the
Government to buy more like a single enterprise by purchasing
commodities and common services consistently and with minimal variation
to leverage the Government’s buying power. Government-wide Category
Managers identify “Best in Class” (BIC) solutions, which are contracting
and acquisition designations used to denote contracts that meet rigorous
category management criteria as defined by OMB. These designated BICs
allow acquisition experts to take advantage of pre-vetted,
Government-wide contract solutions. As stated earlier, Shared Services
is the provision of consolidated capabilities or functions (services
and/or IT systems) that are common across multiple agencies. Shared
information technology relieves customer agencies of managing upgrade
cycles, maintenance, and acquisition overhead associated with supporting
duplicative mission support technologies.

Shared Services intersects with Information Technology Category
Management in that common solutions developed under Category Management
should be leveraged by all agencies, including organizations providing
shared services. Providers assume the responsibility for customers of
managing the contracts/orders, ensuring scalability and efficiency of
services, holding vendors accountable for meeting performance metrics,
and delivering continuous improvement of business process.

Shared services has a long history in the Federal Government and gained
momentum with the establishment of functional lines of business with the
*E-Government Act of 2002*. Building upon this progress and leveraging
best practices from the private sector, in October 2015, OMB announced
the formation of the Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) office
within GSA to enable the delivery of high-quality, high-value shared
services that improve performance and efficiency throughout the Federal
Government. USSM’s mission is to transform the way Government does
business internally to improve the way the Government serves the
American public.

While there has long been interest in shared services for general IT
needs, a perilous threat environment has resulted in a need for
cybersecurity shared services as well as commercially-provided commodity
IT, such as email, and the cloud. Not only would the widespread use and
deployment of shared services in information security provide cost
savings, they would also provide a more consistent level of security
across the Federal enterprise.

**Current State**

Addressing security challenges is critical if the Federal Government
expects to achieve strong security outcomes; however, the current model
of distributed Federal IT makes tackling complex resource-intensive
problems in a consistent manner challenging. Today, each agency must
independently identify possible vendors, evaluate the security of the
vendors, issue an ATO, integrate the solution into their own independent
bespoke IT infrastructure, and allocate resources to monitor and operate
that infrastructure on an ongoing basis. The combination of these
factors does not achieve consistent, high-quality security outcomes.

The Federal Government is the world’s largest buyer and there is a
critical need to change the way the Federal Government buys common
information technology products and services. Transitioning to
consolidated network architectures and shared services requires
consideration of how these products or services will be acquired.
Current challenges associated with use of commercial acquisition
practices limit the Federal Government’s ability to achieve its
modernization goals.

Significant contract duplication means that agencies award multiple
contracts for similar goods and services, often leading to hundreds, if
not thousands, of contracts for the same requirement with the same
vendors. Additionally, there are huge price variances for the exact same
item, sometimes as much as 300 - 400 percent. Agencies work highly
autonomously, with only occasional collaboration across organizations
and little sharing of information, standards, and best practices. This
degree of fragmentation, lack of common standards, and lack of
coordination drives costly redundancies and inefficiencies in
procurement actions, contracting vehicles, and customization of common
information technology solutions.

The existing federated and distributed approach to IT is no longer
sustainable in an increasingly mobile, cloud-based, and complex digital
world. Building or internally operating such security programs requires
specialized cybersecurity talent and knowledge, access to a broad range
of data sources to manage the latest threats, and sophisticated and
costly emulation and static analysis technology. This is an immense
undertaking for large departments, but even more so for smaller and
non-CFO Act agencies who often struggle with basic security functions,
such as vulnerability mitigation, due to resource limitations. Programs
like CDM are taking steps toward deploying common tools across all
agencies and integrating large and small agencies into a shared
cybersecurity understanding; however, many of these programs, including
CDM, have been mired by delays and have not yet yielded their full
promise.

**Future State & Objectives **

In order to reduce cost, improve operational efficiencies and
cybersecurity, the Federal Government must shift toward a consolidated
IT model. This includes adopting shared services for non-mission
specific functions, as well as BIC contracts, commodity IT, such as
email, and other collaboration productivity, and security tools. This
approach will help the Federal Government rapidly deploy new
capabilities that will enhance agencies’ abilities to perform their
missions and secure their networks. The Federal Government must embrace
the broader use of cloud services while working to develop cloud
products that meet Federal cybersecurity standards. With the proper type
of cloud offering designed with an appropriate focus on security, the
increased use and consolidation of IT services in multi-tenant cloud
services can provide the visibility and control necessary to deploy
data-level protections and automated cybersecurity outlined earlier in
this report. Agencies must leverage shared services and embrace
commercial technologies such as Software as a Service (SaaS) where
possible, building new capabilities only when shared services and
commercial technologies cannot meet mission need.

The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing (SP 800-145)[^19] establishes the
essential characteristics and service model definition for cloud-based
SaaS, which also serves as the definition for this Report and its
implementation. Transitioning to a consumption-based service, as opposed
to traditional approaches of purchasing on-premise licenses, will enable
the Government to stop building systems that are expensive to maintain
and modernize. Among other benefits, the Government will only pay for
what it uses, better leverage its buying power, achieve the benefits of
continuous modernization, and gain economies of scale from
standardization.

As Federal agencies increase their investment in commercial cloud
services, promoting vendor interoperability and avoidance of “vendor
lock-in” will continue to be important priorities. Where feasible and
appropriate, the use of tools and platforms that can be used portably
across multiple underlying cloud service providers is encouraged.
Agencies of any significant size, such as CFO Act agencies, are
generally expected to authorize and make use of multiple independent
cloud environments. At the same time, agencies are encouraged to make
use of the best and most cutting-edge services that cloud service
providers have available. This can include services that may be specific
to individual providers’ and which are optimized for their strengths.

In general, agencies should avoid unhealthy levels of dependence on
specific vendors, while taking advantage of the best technologies the
commercial market has to offer.

In order to achieve the desired future state, the Government must
address the current impediments in policy, resource allocation,
Government-wide business standards, and disparate agency interpretations
of statutes and guidance, in addition to other considerations that are
obstacles to agencies’ adoption of shared and cloud services. Such
obstacles include statutory and regulatory requirements that prevent the
use of accepted commercial best acquisition practices. Changes and
modifications to the existing acquisition requirements could be
implemented to achieve efficiencies while maintaining the core tenet of
fairness. Rather than relying on often outdated and agency-specific
systems, the Government should speak with one voice to providers to
obtain systems and services that offer world-class levels of
functionality that meets the Government-wide business standards, achieve
cost-effectiveness through economies of scale, and are secure.

**Implementation Plan**

Both the short- and long-term steps outlined in this section will result
in greater innovation across the Federal enterprise, decrease costs, and
dramatically improve services provided to both agencies and citizens.
These interventions will allow agencies, and particularly smaller
agencies, to more easily acquire and adopt commodity cloud
infrastructure products, while leveraging the Federal Government’s
buying power to produce economies of scale. Additionally, these efforts
will augment existing agency-specific technology to improve both
visibility and security. This implementation plan focuses on three key
areas viewed as pivotal for accelerating the move to shared services:
(1) enabling the use of commercial cloud services and infrastructure;
(2) accelerating adoption of cloud email and collaboration tools; and
(3) providing additional and improving existing shared services.

1.  Enable the Use of Commercial Cloud Services and Infrastructure

Major commercial cloud infrastructure providers offer excellent levels
of functionality, cost effectiveness, and security because of their
ability to aggregate demand across a broad range of customers. There are
a wide range of ways each of the models outlined below can drive cloud
adoption by Government customers; however, it is generally helpful to
think about the options as one default approach and a second option when
security requirements require it.

-   **"Bring the Government to the Cloud."** This approach is the
    recommended default approach the Government should utilize and is
    characterized by multitenant commercially owned infrastructure
    (e.g., building servers, networks, applications) that is shared with
    other non-Government customers, but in which Government data is
    protected through security technologies and encryption.

-   **“Bring the Cloud to the Government."** This approach is
    characterized by multitenant Government-owned and -operated
    infrastructure (e.g., buildings, servers, networks, applications) or
    commercially owned and operated infrastructure isolated and
    dedicated for Government use.

In order to ensure a smooth adoption of cloud technologies across the
Government, it is important to understand the various models that are
available for utilizing cloud services. The following two options
describe the main approaches in which the Government has adopted cloud
services and how these models could be adjusted moving forward.

**Bring Government to the Cloud: Vendor-owned**

**And operated servers and applications — Software as a Service (SaaS)**

This is the ubiquitous public cloud model used by the vast majority of
private sector cloud providers, and is in use by some Federal agencies
today. Among other uses, this model may be appropriate for modern
cloud-hosted email, productivity, and collaboration tools and mission
support services.

Many agencies have already fully embraced vendor-operated, cloud-based
collaboration and productively tools, and, depending on the agency, may
have several such tools based on commercial SaaS in use today in their
environment. It is important for the rest of Government to migrate from
legacy offerings to take advantage of the increased productivity and
innovation that these cloud based services offer.

**Bring Government to the Cloud: Vendor-owned and operated **

**servers and Government-operated applications with networks that
utilize a secure connection — Infrastructure as a Service**

Some service needs can only be met by developing custom software, or by
buying software not available as a service. With this model, a cloud
vendor owns and operates servers in a private sector data center, but
connected through a secure connection. Secure connections could include
HTTPS, TLS, peering, etc. This provides an infrastructure upon which
agencies deploy applications that they create or acquire. This model can
be utilized for secure, critical applications that are only available to
Government users on a virtual private network (VPN) or other
network-level isolation.

Because Infrastructure as a Service gives customers control over many
low-level details, it can entirely replace the need for a traditional on
premise data center. Agencies can often move existing services from
legacy on premise data centers to cloud infrastructure with some
software modifications.

These applications can be public services used by the general public or
private internal services used by agency employees. In either case,
agencies may consider cloud infrastructure as a service to be an
extension of their existing private enterprise network, or they may
treat it as a separate, isolated network. Regardless, users access the
service through secure connections, which could include HTTPS, TLS, VPN,
or a dedicated line.

Infrastructure as a service excels at providing a platform for creating
and deploying the digital services that are core to an agency’s mission.
These models are already in use by agencies in a wide range of use cases
including benefits processing for veterans, immigration, and healthcare,
as well as data processing and software testing in the Department of
Defense community.

**Bring the Cloud to Government: Government-owned data center**

**buildings with vendor-owned and operated services**

For certain applications where using the Internet is not a viable
option, commercial providers can operate infrastructure in
Government-owned facilities. This is attractive for classified systems
that cannot be connected to the public Internet. For example, the
intelligence community was the original adopter of a model in which
vendor-owned and operated services were based out of Government-owned
data center buildings. An example of this approach is the Intelligence
Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE) Commercial Cloud
Services.

This model is much more expensive than fully commercial cloud services,
and cannot keep pace with the innovation of public cloud solutions. As
such, it is only appropriate where the Government absolutely must retain
physical control over the infrastructure.

It is important to be wary of on premise solutions that are sold with
cloud terminology that do not actually meet the NIST Essential
Characteristics of Cloud Computing.[^20] Often, products that claim to
offer private cloud infrastructure fail to deliver on these promises,
missing key aspects such as rapid elasticity, on-demand self-service, or
resource pooling.

**Bring the Cloud to Government: Vendor-owned and **

**operated data centers with servers dedicated for **

**Government use**

Many cloud service providers offer Government-dedicated versions of
their services, where the provider builds segregated space for
Government use so that agency customers only share logical space
(possibly including servers, buildings, networks, personnel) with other
Government customers. This allows a provider to more easily meet
Government-specific compliance requirements for securing sensitive data.

This model provides a middle ground between public shared cloud
infrastructure and costly on premise infrastructure. It is used by many
agencies today to house applications where legal, compliance, or
security reasons preclude the use of shared servers.

This model, which is already in use, could be particularly useful and
appropriate for hosting Government websites and services for
infrastructure that may have sensitivities for which public servers
would not be appropriate.

**Recommendations:**

Cloud is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and offers a multitude of
options for agencies based on their needs and preferences. While it is
important to ensure flexibility across the Federal Government, there are
a few models that can cover the majority of Federal use cases. As such,
the Government should invest in two to three cloud models to support the
differing security and risk-tolerance postures of agencies and leverage
shared services. Further, agencies should work cooperatively and
collaboratively to build trust within their own enterprise and between
agencies so that Federal programs and system owners can make maximum use
of authorization packages, compliance materials, and any other documents
or process that promotes reuse and appropriate risk acceptance when
deciding to bring new systems online or evaluate legacy systems for
migration or decommissioning.

In particular, the Government should expand its use of the “Bring the
Government to the Cloud” models, as these best balance the benefits of
cloud computing—including improved performance and cost-savings—with
outsourced security and control. While the impending revisions to the
TIC policy and guidance will affect some of the eventual business
decisions surrounding cloud options, agencies should begin working to
determine how best to use the models outlined above.

Next steps to support the above recommendations are
as follows:

**Within 30 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

Pursuant to its statutory authorities and in execution thereof, OMB
will conduct a data call requesting that agencies identify systems
that may be ready for cloud migration and can be migrated securely but
have not yet migrated due to perceived or encountered difficulties. At
the conclusion of this data call, OMB and GSA will review the
impediments to moving to the cloud outlined by agencies and will
prioritize an infusion of technical talent, capital, and updated
security policy (developed iteratively to solve agency-specific
issues) as needed to enable prioritized cloud migrations. This task is
described in more detail in the following section.

**Within 90 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

GSA will work with volunteer agencies to pilot new initiatives to
improve the speed, reliability, reusability, and risk acceptance
transparency for cloud-based SaaS and shared services ATOs. Initial
pilots will test new authorities and tools for authorization processes
as automation of the new NIST Risk Management Framework for select
information systems, implementing the new FedRAMP Tailored baseline
for low-impact SaaS products, and leveraging Authorizations to Use for
shared services based on commercial cloud offerings.

Based on the combined efforts, including lessons learned and best
practices for extending these pilot activities to a Federal
civilian-wide scale, GSA will work with OMB to develop any necessary
plans or policy for promoting these initiatives and any other
innovative FedRAMP, shared services, or agency-specific efforts across
the Federal enterprise.

**Within 120 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

Pursuant to its statutory authorities and in execution thereof, OMB,
in coordination with DHS, GSA, and its Federal partners, will update
the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy (“Cloud-First”).[^21] This
strategy will provide additional guidance to agencies on the most
impactful use cases for cloud adoption and how best to conduct
appropriate operational security in cloud environments.

Additionally, OMB will conduct a thorough review of all relevant
policies pertaining to IT modernization, cloud migration,
infrastructure consolidation, and shared services, among others, and
will initiate revisions, rescissions, or other rapid policy updates
that may improve the ability of agencies to modernize effectively,
securely, and efficiently. If necessary, OMB will issue further
guidance that will augment and enhance existing Federal technology and
information security policy.

OMB, working with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Council,
GSA, and DHS will develop clauses that define consistent requirements
for security, privacy, and access to data for use in cloud contracts.
These clauses will ensure uniformity in contract language and provide
rigor to standard Government terms, which would be particularly
valuable to agencies lacking relevant technical, legal, or
acquisitions expertise to craft, out of whole cloth, such language in
their cloud procurements.

**Within 180 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB, working with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR
Council) and DHS will develop clauses that define consistent
requirements for security, privacy, and access to data for use in
cloud contracts. These clauses will ensure uniformity in contract
language and clear direction in standard Government terms, which would
be particularly valuable to agencies lacking relevant technical,
legal, or acquisitions expertise to craft, out of whole cloth, such
language in their cloud procurements.

These actions are in addition to OMB’s ongoing work with the FAR
Council to reduce regulatory burden on federal IT contractors pursuant
to E.O. 13771, as well as efforts with members of the Chief
Acquisition Officers Council to identify statutory or administrative
changes to align federal procurement practices with successful
commercial buying strategies and collaboration with agency Acquisition
Innovation Advocates to apply modernized processes to improve the
acquisition system’s ability to support the goals of this report.

1.  Accelerate Adoption of Cloud Email and Collaboration Tools

Accelerated adoption of tools like cloud email and collaboration
applications is an essential element to achieving timely collaboration
capability across the Government. Deploying these tools for the Federal
Government sooner rather than later minimizes exposure of one the most
prominent cyberattack methods in modern society. Targeted, email-based
spear phishing attacks using malicious attachments and links are the
primary attack vector for compromising individuals and organizations.

Accelerated rollout of cloud email and collaboration is urgent given the
number of duplicative legacy systems and their associated cybersecurity
risks. In addition, even within cloud-based email, there still exists
price variance. Agencies generally negotiate as individual organizations
- thus limiting the potential economy of scale that could have been
achieved negotiating through the Government Enterprise. Buying power
through Government-wide price negotiations will achieve efficiencies of
cost savings and therefore benefit American taxpayers.

In order to support agencies in moving away from their own email servers
and solutions, a set of secure, easy-to-maintain, and cost-effective
solutions must be available. Industry is well positioned to provide
effective security controls, especially when paired with NCPS
capabilities and to enable agencies to leverage improved mobile, tablet,
and productivity operating environments. There are currently only two
hosted solutions deployed in the Federal Government, though additional
competitors could emerge. Regardless, a requirement to make better use
of cloud-based email and collaboration services increases the
Government’s leverage in obtaining farther reaching innovative solutions
and better pricing.

While the benefits are worthwhile, ranging from cost savings to improved
security, the migration itself to cloud-based tools can be costly and
burdensome, particularly for smaller agencies. In order to support
agencies in their migration, a set of secure, easy-to-maintain, and
cost-effective solutions must be made available.

The Government must pursue new acquisition strategies to obtain cloud
email and collaboration tools and services. In furtherance of this
objective, pilots such as the example outlined in Appendix D may be
executed to decrease the administrative acquisition burden, specifically
for smaller agencies who cannot leverage large volume discounts or who
have acquisition workforce constraints. Additional pilots may include
the ability to purchase cloud services on a consumption basis and
coordinated purchasing to obtain tiered-based pricing.

One of the fundamental advantages the Government has in seeking products
and services is that its size should allow it to leverage competing
market forces to drive Government-wide volume pricing and increase the
overall speed of migration. The goal would be to incentivize providers
through tiered pricing, business strategies, and service level
agreements that would produce insight and transparency into any
agreement made to obtain cloud email and collaboration tools by the
Government.

This would mark a significant departure from existing acquisition
marketplaces where existing models are laborious for both Government and
industry and fail to truly capture and make transparent items such as
volume spending as an aggregated value. In addition, the current process
does not always offer sufficient transparency, allowing some agencies to
pay less than others. Often, it is the small agencies, who can least
afford higher prices, that are penalized.

Next steps to support the above recommendations are as follows:

**Within 30 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will conduct a data call to agencies regarding their current email
contracts, prices, and number of mailboxes. It is imperative that the
Government obtain an accurate measurement of the market size of
agencies who have not yet migrated to cloud email. While there are
clear data on the current need among CFO Act agencies, there is
currently no definitive data regarding the adoption of cloud-based
email solutions at small and independent agencies. Understanding the
full size of the marketplace will enable the Government to maximize
its leverage in negotiations with cloud collaboration vendors.

OMB will convene a task force of agencies to finalize a standard set
of requirements for cloud email, including both low and moderate
security postures for email and cloud collaboration. These
requirements, which will build upon previously completed work, will be
circulated to all agencies for comment and serve as the basis for
acquisition.

**Within 60 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will establish a comprehensive strategy for driving the
accelerated migration of agency email and collaboration tools to the
cloud for departments and agencies who have still not adopted
cloud-based email. This strategy should emphasize achieving both cost
savings and improved security.

**Within 75 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will issue updated identity policy guidance for public comment
that will reduce agency burden and recommend identity service areas
suitable for shared services. GSA will provide a business case to the
Federal CIO on the consolidation of existing identity services to
improve usability and drive secure access and interoperability. This
action will enable secure access and collaboration as a service in a
way that improves existing agency-specific implementations, which
often have various levels of security and do not include
interoperability.

**Within 90 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB will assemble an Acquisition Tiger Team (ATT), which will be
charged with drafting and disseminating a “quick start” acquisition
package that can help agencies facilitate rapid license and migration
service acquisitions. This will make it possible for agencies to award
licenses and services that may presently have difficulty doing so. The
“quick start” package would include market research, acquisition
plans, templates for requesting quotes, identified sources of supply,
and Independent Government Cost Estimate calculation templates (based
on already completed acquisitions).

The ATT, working through the appropriate executive agent, will send
out Requests for Information (RFIs) or conduct other market research
activities to find qualified small business and socio-economic
concerns to leverage set aside programs and other authorities to
streamline the migration acquisitions to the greatest extent possible.
For example, using the 8(a) Digital Service Initiative or vehicles
that have resulted from Category Management efforts in this
space.[^22]

**Within 180 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

The Government should consider incentives for early adoption
(migration in the first year following the formalization of the
effort), including individualized assistance tailored to a given
agency’s needs. To assist in such an effort, OMB will create
acquisition/migration cadres, consisting of information technology and
acquisition specialists that will be sent to early adopter agencies to
help with license and migration acquisitions-related challenges.
Initially, these cadres would draw from agencies that have already
completed their migrations, such as the Department of the Justice
(DOJ) and acquisition experts from the Digital IT Acquisition
Professional Training (DITAP) alumni network.

**Within 240 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB, with support from GSA, will pilot new acquisition tactics for
cloud email and collaboration licenses including but not limited to
those discussed above and outlined in Appendix D.

**Other High-Level Actions:**

Approved FISMA-Moderate cloud-based collaboration tools currently
exist. GSA will continue to work with existing cloud email and
collaboration providers, and will prioritize approval of a FISMA-High
offering. At the same time, process improvements will continue
iteratively to enable agencies to accelerate adoption of cloud
services.

Within the Federal Government, having a qualified and agile
acquisition workforce is paramount to ensure the Federal Government
acquires optimal solutions to achieve successful acquisition outcomes.
Providing specialized training and career development opportunities
for the acquisition workforce is a critical component for ensuring tax
payer dollars are effectively managed and obligated to achieve the
requirements addressed in the Federal IT Modernization Report.
Providing training and career development opportunities is a
priority for cybersecurity adoption, cloud email, and cloud adoption.
The Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) core plus
specialization in digital services is under review and is a component
of the DITAP development program. The DITAP program focuses on
providing contracting professionals with training and experiential
learning opportunities to gain the expertise necessary to better
understand the market conditions and drivers, effectively manage risks
to successfully plan, and negotiate and acquire digital supplies and
services. Moreover, completion of the DITAP development
program empowers the graduates to serve as change agents and expert
business advisors to members of the integrated acquisition team
(program managers, legal, finance, contracting officer's
representative and other stakeholders). Having a Government-wide,
holistic and integrated training and career development approach is
vital to deliver results to the American People and build a stronger
more capable Federal Government.

1.  Improve Existing and Provide Additional Security Shared Services

As cyberattacks have become more sophisticated, frequent, and easier for
adversaries to execute, cybersecurity has continued to escalate as a
primary responsibility for all individual agencies and for the Federal
Government as a whole. Addressing cybersecurity threats holistically
necessitates both a further consolidation of the Federal Government’s IT
footprint as well as an expansion of shared, centralized services to
better leverage Federal buying power, standardize security capabilities,
improve the time it takes to detect and respond to incidents, and
realize economies of scale from aggregating data.

**Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM)**

DHS established the CDM Program in 2013 to provide Federal civilian
agencies with automated continuous monitoring tools to detect
vulnerabilities and potentially malicious network activity in near
real-time.[^23]^,^ [^24] CDM Phase 1, which is currently being deployed,
is designed to determine “what is on the network” by providing agencies
with capabilities to identify and remediate vulnerabilities and ensure
secure hardware and software configurations on their networks. CDM Phase
2 will focus on “who is on the network” and provide capabilities to
detect and manage privileged user access and ensure that only
authorized, credentialed users have access to information on the
network. CDM Phase 3 will report “what is happening on the network” and
provide capabilities to identify and assess anomalies that may indicate
a cybersecurity compromise and to implement ongoing assessment and
authorization. CDM Phase 4 will focus on expanding data protections for
Government information. All CDM capabilities will feed information to
both an agency- and Federal-level dashboard, enabling Government-wide
visibility into the current state of Federal information security.

Up to this point, CDM has not sought to address cloud-hosted systems and
has instead focused on helping agencies secure their on premise
networks. While this does introduce some limitations, the program has
nonetheless elevated the baseline of cybersecurity across the
Government. Over the identified phases, the program will deliver
capabilities through various mechanisms, including an “as-a-service
model,” to ensure that additional capabilities can be provided in a more
centralized and standard way.

A challenge in implementing CDM capabilities in a more cloud-friendly
architecture is that security teams and security operations centers may
not necessarily have the expertise available to defend the updated
architecture. To support agency cybersecurity efforts, the Federal
Government is working to develop this expertise and provide it across
agencies through CDM. Currently, all CFO Act agencies (except the
Department of Defense) participate in CDM, as do 44 of the non-CFO Act
agencies in the Federal enterprise. CDM will continue to grow and
provide sophisticated tools and services to current agencies, while
working to onboard the other small agencies not currently served by the
program.

This is imperative for enabling the Federal Government to increase
security throughout the Federal enterprise. Further targeted actions by
DHS’s CDM Program Office and agencies can help expedite the
modernization and adoption of CDM to identify, detect, and respond to
threats in the Federal Government’s increasing move to cloud
environments and mobile devices.

**Within 60 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS, in partnership with agencies and GSA, will complete the
acquisition strategy for new, long-term task orders to offer CDM
lifecycle support to agencies and provide solution development and
implementation for Phases 3 and 4 in addition to future work,
including cloud security.

**Within 125 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS will leverage all available departmental resources, to the extent
practicable, to obtain an initial ATO for the CDM Group F Platform. If
necessary, DHS will request additional support from OMB, GSA, or other
entities to ensure an efficient authorization, consistent with the
appropriate security posture required of the CDM Program, potential
customer agencies, and the authorizing official. Upon completion of
the authorization process, DHS will begin onboarding agencies onto CDM
to provide continuous monitoring as a service capabilities.

At the end of the 125 days, DHS will update OMB on the current number
and status of remaining Memoranda of Agreement it has established with
non-CFO Act agencies (above and beyond the current number of 44). DHS
will also submit a plan to OMB that details the expectations and
timelines for onboarding non-CFO Act agencies to the CDM Group F
Platform.

**Within 150 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS will complete the data exchanges between the agency- and
Federal-level dashboards to provide enterprise-wide situational
awareness of an agency’s cyber posture.

**Within 180 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

DHS, in partnership with the Federal CIO Council, will implement a
concept of operations for the Federal dashboard to include procedures
to manage cyber risks across the Federal enterprise, and other factors
pertinent to the broader Federal CIO community.

**Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Service**

The Security Operations Center (SOC), which generally provides central
visibility into the state of security on an agency’s networks, is an
essential component of securing the Federal IT enterprise; however, many
agencies lack the resources or expertise to establish their own
agency-level SOCs. Given the vulnerability this creates, the
establishment of a SOC as a service (SOCaaS) capability is essential to
ensure appropriate enterprise-wide visibility, incident discovery, and
information sharing among Federal agencies. Such a capability would
allow agencies currently lacking such capabilities to purchase them from
those agencies with sufficient capacity to offer such a service. This
could allow for the creation of specialized offerings. For instance,
agencies who have demonstrated expertise in defending cloud applications
could expand their current SOC capabilities and offer a SOCaaS, focusing
specifically on cloud applications. In addition, contracts can be
established with commercial providers to provide SOCaaS offerings.
Agencies lacking the requisite expertise could leverage these services
to accelerate their migration to commercial cloud capabilities.

Over time, agencies offering SOCaaS could provide a full suite of
capabilities to agencies that do not want or need to manage their own
operations. This would align with the consolidation of existing
networks. A more consolidated SOC would have broader visibility, easier
communications, and the ability to add tools not available in a more
distributed model.

Specifically, SOC as a Service capabilities could:

-   Prevent security capabilities from causing latency issues;

-   Apply security protections at the application and data levels which
    are commensurate with the sensitivity of the data;

-   Offer capabilities for multiple types of logs or data flows
    depending on cloud provider technology and contract specifications;
    and

-   Allow visibility across multiple agency cloud systems to be
    aggregated and managed centrally.

**Within 180 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

OMB, DHS, and GSA will identify potential offerings to provide SOC as
a Service capabilities to other agencies across the Federal
Government. Additionally, GSA, in coordination with OMB and DHS, will
lead contracting efforts to also offer commercially available SOC as a
Service capabilities to Federal agencies.

**Within 210 days of the date of issuance of this final report:**

Any agency that plans to offer SOC as a Service capabilities will
provide to OMB and DHS a pricing model in alignment with the cloud
migration strategy and timeline outlined above. Additionally, OMB will
designate a slate of agencies with insufficient SOC capabilities and
require them to establish plans for transitioning to SOC as a Service,
whether it is Government or private sector provided.

**Other High-Level Actions:**

DHS will work with SOC as a Service providers, be it a Government or
private sector provider, to ensure that NCPS and CDM capabilities and
outcomes can be achieved and that the visibility remains aggregated
across cloud and on premise security capabilities. Additionally,
agencies designated as potential SOC as a Service providers will
establish pilots involving agencies designated by OMB as possessing
insufficient SOC capabilities.

**Conclusions & Summary of Requests for Engagement**
====================================================

Difficulties in agency prioritization of resources in support of IT
modernization, ability to procure services quickly, and technical issues
have resulted in an unwieldy and out-of-date Federal IT infrastructure
incapable of operating with the agility and security that is required of
a multibillion-dollar Federal IT enterprise. In order to aggressively
modernize IT systems, the Federal Government will need to maximize use
of shared services and commercial capabilities. In furtherance of this
objective, existing policies and programs will be rapidly and
iteratively updated to eliminate barriers to cloud adoption, and
agencies will rapidly migrate applicable capabilities to commercial
cloud services. Capabilities which will not be hosted in the commercial
cloud will be modernized to leverage modern security protections, and
agencies will assess risk of existing capabilities to prioritize
resources on protecting the most important systems and information. The
Federal Government will also accelerate the adoption of cloud email and
collaboration tools, improve and strengthen existing shared services,
and provide additional security shared services for agencies.

Achieving these goals will require an active shift in the mindset of
agency leadership, mission owners, IT practitioners, and oversight
bodies. Federal agencies must consolidate their IT investments and place
more trust in services and infrastructure operated by others. Such a
change in outlook will allow for greater utilization of shared services,
consolidated infrastructure, and cloud-based collaboration tools that
can deliver improved functionality and drive cost efficiencies to
improve Government operations and citizen services.

**Appendix A: Data-Level Protections and Modernization of Federal IT**

This report envisions a modern Federal IT enterprise that relies on
**logical protections** and **automation**, and is focused on
**empirical evidence** and **security outcomes**.

Below are some capabilities and approaches Federal agencies are expected
to use to improve the agility of their enterprise and the security of
their IT systems.

**Logical Protections**

Agencies should rely principally on logical protections, such as
encryption and granular permissions, to protect data. When designing
mitigations, networks should be considered untrusted, and system
components should be assumed to be potentially compromised.

**Encrypting Data in Transit.** Encrypting data as it transits from one
device or system component to another protects data from modification or
interception from an attacker with a network vantage point. Network
routes that transit data between information system components, or
between information systems and their users, should generally be treated
as untrusted, even within agency-operated networks. In general, systems
should rely only on protocols that can safely “fail closed” (default to
connection failure), under attack scenarios. Examples include Secure
Shell (SSH) or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).

**Encrypting Data at Rest**. Encrypting data using tools that implement
NIST standards and guidelines, when stored, whether in a database or
some other persistent storage, is designed to make that data useless to
an attacker, should an attacker gain access to that storage system and
copy the data. Effective designs for encryption of data at rest should
consider how to limit an attacker’s options both during and after the
attacker maintains control of the information system, such as by
requiring the presence of a hardware security module to perform (and
rate limit) decryption actions. Like encryption in other areas,
encryption at rest generally requires sufficiently strong encryption
keys with sufficient randomness in key generation.[^25]

**Multi-Factor Authentication**. The goal of multi-factor authentication
is to make remote attacks unattractive, typically by requiring the
production of a credential that is connected to a specific user in a
physical manner in order to grant the user access to a system. Recent
Federal efforts have focused on multi-factor authentication for
privileged users, or those with elevated access privileges, but thus far
has largely centered on network access rather than system and
application-level access.

**Least Privilege.** The principle of least privilege is intended to
prevent the compromise of individual users and information system
components to lead to the total compromise of an information system.
This principle can be applied both to users and to components of
information systems. Privileged users should only be granted privileged
access to the system components they need to perform their job, which
can require richer permissions models than simply designating “admins.”
Similarly, system components, such as individual servers and endpoints,
should themselves be limited in their ability to connect or exchange
information to only the components they need in order to perform their
function. Mature privilege management programs may also be able to
leverage policy- or attribute-based access controls, wherein
sophisticated rules-based policies (which can be dynamically updated and
enforced) can support a system that makes privilege escalation more
expensive and difficult for an attacker.

**Application Whitelisting.** The purpose of application whitelisting is
to allow only approved applications and application components
(libraries, configuration files, etc.) to run on a host according to a
well-defined baseline, while preventing all other applications from
running by default. When implemented, application whitelisting is an
effective security technique that helps stop the execution of malicious
malware and other unauthorized software.[^26]

**Mobile Device Management.** Mobile devices often need additional
protection because their nature generally places them at higher exposure
to threats than other devices typically used within Government
facilities, such as desktops and laptops. When planning mobile device
security policies and controls, agencies should assume that mobile
devices will be acquired by malicious parties who will attempt to
recover sensitive data either directly from the devices themselves or
indirectly by using the devices to access the organization’s remote
resources. Therefore, a layered mitigation strategy should be used that
includes user authentication to the device, protection of data either
through encryption or by not storing data on the device, and user
training and awareness to reduce the frequency of insecure physical
security practices. Additionally, agencies should plan their mobile
device security on the assumption that unknown third-party mobile device
applications downloadable by users should not be trusted. Risk from
these applications can be reduced in several ways, such as prohibiting
all installation of third-party applications, implementing whitelisting
to allow installation of approved applications only, verifying that
applications only receive the necessary permissions on the mobile
device, or implementing a secure sandbox/secure container that isolates
the organization’s data and applications from all other data and
applications on the mobile device.[^27]

**Automation and outcome-oriented security**

Agencies should gain confidence in their security posture through
empirical evidence and measurable improvement over time. To do this,
agencies must take an iterative approach to security, and have the
agility to change their practices to adapt to the threats they and other
agencies observe. Automation is a critical tool to maintain agility in
system design and to make the best use of finite human resources.

**External Security Testing.** Agencies must take a layered approach to
penetration testing and system assessments that incorporates as much
ongoing external review as possible. At a bare minimum, agencies should
establish vulnerability disclosure policies for at least their
public-facing services, so that security researchers and other members
of the public can report vulnerabilities they discover. Agencies should
also identify systems that are appropriate to place under public bug
bounty programs, such as those run by the Department of Defense or
GSA.[^28] Private bounty programs, where researchers may be vetted,
monitored, and given credentialed access, can be an additional useful
tool for building confidence in a system, and can be run in parallel to,
or in advance of, a public program. Bounty programs require
vulnerabilities to be fixable in a reasonably rapid time frame, and can
be implemented for specific systems, for short periods of time or on an
ongoing basis. Agencies have many options for incorporating external
security testing of their systems, and should bring as many as feasible
to bear on their most important systems.

**Avoiding security through obscurity.** Internet-wide scanning and
discovery is commonplace and effective. Agencies must assume that their
publicly accessible systems are trivially publicly discoverable to
adversaries, and prioritize the sharing of information about their
systems with defenders inside and outside the Federal enterprise.
Similarly, agencies should support the use and release of open-source
software where it improves agency agility and resilience.

**Threat Modeling.** Agencies should use threat modeling to understand
and drive improvements in the security of their systems. Threat models
define what threats a system is designed to mitigate, and what threats
the system is not designed to mitigate. This focuses resources in the
areas where risk reduction is needed the most, and forms a cornerstone
of implementing a risk-based practice of security, as described in the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

**Continuous integration and code review.** Agencies should follow a
“DevSecOps” model, using automated unit and integration tests to aid the
code review process and maintain ongoing confidence in the system.
Rather than onerous change control boards, agencies should employ
automatic testing and widely visible code review to measure and
accelerate the time it takes for code changes to be deployed to
production.

**Automated Deployments.** System deployments should be automated to the
greatest extent possible, removing the potential for errors caused by
breakdowns in internal processes. To support this, configuration and
environmental details that support system deployment should be versioned
and managed similarly to the software that comprises the system itself.
This practice is necessary to achieve long-term consistency among
critical system components, maintain adequate patching, and update
velocity.

**Immutable Deployments.** Production deployments should be automated
and designed so that components are not modified in place between
deployments. Modification should be technically constrained wherever
possible; for example, deployed servers should not allow remote logins.
By taking advantage of virtualized infrastructure, new deployments can
create brand new instances of deployed system software and supporting
components, rather than updating the existing environment in place. This
approach allows system owners to design their security architecture and
monitoring to treat any in-place modification as a potential attack, and
to use more comprehensive technical constraints on modification that
remove opportunities for attackers to persist in a deployed environment.

**Timely Patching.** Unpatched software vulnerabilities remains one of
the most significant threats to Federal IT systems. DHS currently scans
external-facing agency systems for known unpatched vulnerabilities, and
agencies are currently required to patch critical vulnerabilities within
30 days; however, depending on the severity and ease of exploitation,
unpatched vulnerabilities in public-facing systems can lead to
compromise in weeks, days, or even hours of public disclosure. Agencies
should consider patching agility and responsiveness to be a critical
security metric and modernization goal. Automated scanning, consistent
software baselines, and easy and immutable deployments are all critical
to bringing expected patch times down to acceptable levels.

**Appendix B: Principles of Cloud-Oriented Security Protections**

As noted in this Report, the Federal Government has traditionally
focused its Government-wide information security efforts on protecting
network boundaries; however, instead of emphasizing physically
consolidated security at the perimeter, such as in the current Trusted
Internet Connections (TIC) model, a data-centric approach emphasizes
placing protections closer to the services and information systems in
which sensitive data is stored and accessed. This gives agencies
flexibility in the approaches they choose. For modern services hosted in
the cloud, agencies can place security protections directly in front of
each service and allow direct connections from the public internet. For
services hosted in legacy data centers, such capabilities may not be
available, in which case the agency can still rely on perimeter security
as they pursue options to modernize their system architecture.

There is no one right way for an agency to operationalize security
protections in Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), and some features and
approaches may need to be optimized for the particular cloud service
provider in use. Agencies should ensure any CSP they choose meets the
security capabilities outlined by FedRAMP. The approach in this appendix
applies to cases wherein an agency is directly operationalizing software
in a cloud-hosting environment. This does not apply to Software as a
Service (SaaS) applications operated in full by vendors, as their
security approaches will be vendor-specific.

Agencies could take the following approach to designing security
protections in a cloud-based application stack:

-   An agency could separate their security stack from their application
    stack within their cloud provider. In whatever way this separation
    occurs, agencies should maintain the principle that a compromise of
    the application being protected should not automatically lead to
    compromise of the security stack being used to protect that
    application and vice versa;

-   Incoming traffic could be routed through the cloud provider’s
    commodity virtualized load balancers, used to obtain a carbon-copy
    of the data, to a set of virtual security appliances. These virtual
    security appliances would process incoming traffic “on path,”
    meaning that incoming requests are blocked on the ability of the
    security appliances to process them. Since putting any devices “on
    path” of existing traffic has significant reliability, security, and
    performance implications, the choice of security functions for this
    purpose must be warranted by the sensitivity of the application.
    Lower sensitivity applications likely warrant few, if any, “on path”
    request processing services;

-   These virtual appliances could themselves implement most of the
    security functions described by existing TIC policy, including
    intrusion detection, filtering, and logging. Importantly, these
    virtual appliances must be horizontally scalable so that any number
    of instances can handle as much traffic as the service might
    receive; and

-   After the traffic is processed by the virtual security appliances,
    it exits the segregated security zone. It is then sent to the
    application’s load balancer to be processed normally by the
    application.

An example diagram showing data-centric security in a cloud provider is
shown in **Figure 1**. ![ATC Networks - Cloud
Moderate.png](media/image1.png){width="6.5067935258092735in"
height="2.674433508311461in"}

**Figure 1**

This data-centric application security layer could be implemented
directly by an application team, or it could be run by an agency as an
internal shared service for all applications hosted within a particular
cloud provider. It could also be possible for a sufficiently responsive
agency team to provide this layer as a shared service to multiple
agencies who utilize the same cloud provider.

To achieve centralized visibility for agency security teams, this
data-centric application security layer should send logs and alerts in
real time to centralized aggregation systems that process security
information and events. These centralized aggregation systems could be
co-located in the same cloud provider as the applications from which
they are aggregating information. They could also aggregate logs and
network flow information received from the cloud service provider
itself. One operational approach for doing this is described in the
Security Operations Center as a Service section of this report.

**Government-Wide Visibility and Classified Indicators**

Some Government-specific security functions, such as the intrusion
detection and prevention capabilities of 6 U.S.C. § 151, currently
offered as EINSTEIN, would not be automatically fulfilled by commodity
solutions. Some needs, for example, can only be addressed with
classified indicators. This produces a challenge for agencies, as these
classified indicators can only be stored in data centers meeting very
specific security requirements. For most systems, however, these
Government-specific functions, such as EINSTEIN 1 and EINSTEIN 2, do not
leverage classified indicators or need to be physically “on path” for
network traffic and incoming requests. Instead, the virtual appliances
in the data-centric security layer could create a copy of relevant
traffic or logs and send a stream to a nearby location (perhaps operated
by DHS as part of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities of
6 U.S.C. § 151) where these Government-specific security functions can
be performed in the background. The original copy of the traffic
continues to flow to the cloud provider unless, depending on the
capability at issue, an alert is generated from the intrusion prevention
system. This achieves visibility and detection of classified threats
without sacrificing the major benefits of adopting modern cloud
architectures. A diagram of how this may look is represented in Figure
2.

![ATC Networks - Cloud High.png](media/image2.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.229166666666667in"}

**Figure 2**

DHS should also consider evolving NCPS’s intrusion prevention
capabilities program to include the ability to receive and act on
additional application layer traffic. In its current form, EINSTEIN 3A
does not process most web traffic, because it only examines email and
domain name server.

The data-centric approach outlined above also allows a more nuanced
approach to protection, allowing security teams to focus their efforts
on the systems that need it most. For low-impact systems that only store
public data, it is likely unnecessary to split off traffic for
classified analysis. For high-sensitivity systems with very valuable
private data, it may be useful to require more security measures, such
as waiting for classified analysis to be complete before passing traffic
along to the application.

**Proportionate Security**

While the protections described in this appendix can be useful to many
applications, the Federal Government should focus its limited security
resources on its highest-value assets. All security protections come
with a cost: any security services “on path” can impact reliability and
performance, add complexity to system operations, and could have
vulnerabilities that would be used against the applications they are
intended to defend. Even “off path” security services that do not
process data in real time, such as classified indicators and services
that provide Government-wide visibility, add complexity as well as
oversight and compliance costs to system operation.

For the Government’s security protections to be most effective, they
should be deployed on systems whose data is worth such a sustained and
sophisticated defense, such as HVAs. Systems that contain information
that would have a low impact if compromised should instead be optimized
for agility and availability, thus freeing security resources for more
sensitive systems.

An isolated system with no sensitive information therefore might merit a
more streamlined architecture. **Figure 3** shows how a low-impact
system may serve requests directly:

**Appendix C: Challenges to Implementing Federal-Wide Perimeter-Based
Security**

Today, the Federal Government applies a defense-in-depth strategy to
protect its systems that includes agency and DHS-provided protections at
various levels. But, at the same time, Government-wide programs overly
rely on a perimeter-based security model to protect the Government’s
networks and information systems. This model, formalized in OMB
Memorandum M-08-05, *Implementation of Trusted Internet Connections
(TIC)*, focuses on standardizing security at the network boundary
through consolidation of external access points. Under this model, the
Government has required agencies to reduce external connections, to a
target of 50, and route their traffic through this limited number of
secure gateways. These gateways apply common intrusion detection and
prevention capabilities under DHS’s National Cybersecurity Protection
System (NCPS). NCPS consists of three sensor capabilities (collectively
referred to as EINSTEIN), as well as a set of analytic tools used by
cyber analysts to find, identify and categorize cyber threat activity.
[^29]

The NCPS sensor suite is deployed in three iterations: EINSTEIN 1 (E1),
which captures and analyzes network flow information; EINSTEIN 2 (E2),
which incorporates intrusion detection technology that scans the content
of network communications to identify and alert to known indications of
malicious activity; and EINSTEIN 3-Accelerated (E3A), which detects and
blocks malicious activity through DNS sinkholing and email filtering.

This perimeter-based architecture has created several challenges,
specifically regarding adoption of commercial cloud and mobile
technologies. Additionally, signature-based detection and protections
systems provide value, but are not enough to combat the full spectrum of
advanced persistent threats that rapidly change attack vectors, tactics,
techniques, and procedures.[^30]^,^ [^31] All of these challenges are
acknowledged and understood by DHS, and efforts are underway to address
these specific issues.

As an overarching effort, DHS has undertaken a cybersecurity
architectural review of Federal, Civilian, and Executive Branch
infrastructure to capture empirical data, which will be used to
determine the efficacy of individual and collective groupings of
capabilities against specific threats to that architecture. This data
will then be used to guide the evolution of DHS cyber program
capabilities, to include NCPS and the CDM program.

In addition to the holistic architecture review, DHS has continuously
assessed its programs to determine if the program investments they are
making are appropriate. As part of this continuous assessment, DHS has
identified several challenges that must be addressed to improve and
deliver value to its Federal Executive Branch stakeholder community.
These challenges include:

1.  Cloud Security and Situational Awareness

2.  Encrypted Network Traffic

3.  Overreliance on Static Signatures

4.  Use and Value of Classified Indicators

**Cloud Security and Situational Awareness**

Federal agencies have started to embrace the use of cloud services to
include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service
(PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), which has the promise to move
much of the Federal Executive Branch’s computing and data to
commercially available cloud environments, outside of traditional
network boundaries. In doing so, the emphasis on protecting and
monitoring perimeter connections of trusted networks at a limited number
of physical TIC access points has introduced performance degradation.
This has discouraged agencies from fully adopting cloud services, and
undermines many of their key benefits such as reducing costs,
flexibility, time-to-deploy, and availability and reliability. An
example of a current network routing challenge for agencies that have
adopted cloud services is an agency that has implemented a public-facing
web service must route user traffic through a limited number of physical
TIC access points for inspection, which in turn introduces latency. The
diagram below illustrates how this approach is currently implemented, in
a phenomenon known as “the network trombone,” which constrains the
benefits of cloud services by forcing users to route traffic through a
physical network location rather than being able to connect directly to
the cloud service.

![ATC Networks - TIC
Trombone.png](media/image4.png){width="6.499209317585302in"
height="3.7777777777777777in"}

To address this situation, DHS has engaged with three large cloud
service providers to determine how DHS may gain the insight and
situational awareness from within the cloud that is similar to the
information that is gained from its E1 and E2 sensors that are deployed
at the TICs. The focus of this engagement thus far has been the
collection of internal cloud log data, specific to the agency
application and data that could be fed back to DHS to provide a similar
level of situational awareness to DHS cyber analysts.

**Encrypted Network Traffic**

As the use of cloud and web services continues to expand, so has the use
of network transport security in the form of encrypted tunnels between
end users and their applications and data. The use of transport
encryption is critical for secure communications, but limits what is
visible to a perimeter-based monitoring system such as E1 or E2. The
amount of network traffic that is encrypted that passes through E1 and
E2 sensors has increased over time, with 47 percent of all traffic being
encrypted as of December 2016. This continued growth of encrypted
network traffic has limited the functionality and usefulness of E1 and
E2 sensors and has made it difficult for DHS to inspect this traffic for
cyber threats. For DHS E2 sensors, this means that DHS signatures are
unable to inspect the content of network communications and alert on
malicious content.

Continued growth in encryption is both beneficial and inevitable, and
DHS has commissioned research to determine potential architectural,
technical, and policy mitigation strategies that could provide DHS with
both the protection and situational awareness for encrypted traffic.
Some of the mitigation strategies currently under evaluation include:

1.  **Sensor Placement**. This involves relocating the E1 and E2 sensors
    where the traffic is decrypted (e.g., endpoints of an encrypted
    tunnel). In the cases of virtual private network tunnels, one could
    place sensors outside of encrypted areas. For cloud environments,
    investigation is needed to determine how these sensors could be
    virtualized and placed in physical or virtual locations where
    Government applications and data exist.

2.  **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Interception**. This involves deploying
    MITM technologies that decrypt traffic, inspect it, and re-encrypt
    it, by placing a proxy along the network path. This proxy falsely
    pretends to each side to be the other side of the communications.
    Network proxies that intercept Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    traffic via MITM are commercially available. Usually this requires
    local clients to have blanket trust of this proxy.

3.  **Key Escrow**. This involves gaining access to decryption keys
    (e.g., as part of a broader certificate management system and
    architecture). A key escrow approach requires clients to register
    keys with a trusted third party.

**Overreliance on Static Signatures**

The use of signatures, or software code that inspects network traffic to
look for known content, ports, and protocols, has been a fundamental
part of cybersecurity practice. Similar to how anti-virus software
works, intrusion detection and prevention technologies inspect traffic
to look for matches against signatures of known malicious content or
behavior. Although signature-based technology is widely accepted as an
effective and necessary piece of cyber defense, it is not enough to
protect against the most advanced and persistent threats facing the
Government today. NCPS uses signatures within their E2 intrusion
detection and E3A prevention capability areas. In recognition of the
limitations of signature-only systems, DHS has been piloting an
anomalous analytics capability that leverages artificial intelligence to
detect malicious activity across networks that will allow DHS to both
respond to previously unidentified incidents. DHS can then rapidly
generate new signatures for both EINSTEIN sensors and agency defenses to
protect the Government from those threats. DHS has seen some early
success from this pilot and is planning to build a production-grade
system that could be deployed at various points across the .gov
architecture, both inside and outside agency network and computing
enclaves.

**Use and Value of Classified Indicators**

The use of signatures in intrusion detection and prevention systems are
based on pieces of information known as cyber threat indicators. These
“indicators” can be any piece of observable information about the
network traffic such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name,
or file hash, that may indicate whether the traffic entering or exiting
a network may be suspicious or malicious. DHS sources its indicators
from multiple sources to include in-house analysis of Government
traffic, commercial and open-source cyber threat data, and the
intelligence community. Although all of the signatures within the E2
system are unclassified, significant portions of the signatures in the
E3A intrusion prevention capability are classified. The use of
classified indicators and signatures within the E3A system has been a
long-standing challenge for the NCPS program because of the
unprecedented way in which classified information is placed on
unclassified networks for the purposes of protecting unclassified .gov
network traffic. The continued use of classified information in E3A has
been recognized as a cost and schedule driver, as well as limiting the
range of technical capabilities available. Moreover, the use of
classified information has limited the ability of DHS to engage and
communicate with the agencies it helps to protect because not all
agencies have personnel with the appropriate security clearances to
discuss the indicators or the alerts that are generated by the system.
To address this issue, DHS has commissioned a study to understand the
value of using classified indicators within E3A to determine if their
use should be continued, or if DHS and the agencies would be better
served by using only unclassified information.

**Appendix D: Acquisition Pilot: Change the Buying Strategy to
Government-As-One-Purchaser**

The Government must pursue new acquisition strategies for cloud email
and collaboration licenses. In furtherance of this objective, pilots
such as the example outlined in this Appendix may be executed to
decrease the administrative acquisition burden, specifically for smaller
agencies who cannot leverage large volume discounts or who have
acquisition workforce constraints. Additional pilots to leverage the
Government as one purchaser and speed cloud adoption may include the
ability to purchase cloud services on a consumption basis and
coordinated purchasing to obtain tiered-based pricing.

Several challenges must be overcome in the acquisition cycle in order to
comply with EO 13800 and facilitate shared services, such as cloud
email. Budgets are constrained by yearly appropriations, and agencies
work autonomously, which reduces the Government’s ability to look at its
purchasing as a whole. Legacy procurement and security regulations,
coupled with lack of top down guidance for the logistics of a
Government-wide migration to cloud email challenge cloud adoption.

By creating virtual “street corners” for cloud email providers the
Federal Government can use competing market forces to drive
Government-wide volume pricing as a lever to speed migration. This will
apply Hotelling’s Law of spatial competition, wherein Government’s
potential purchasing power will be used to negotiate tiered pricing
agreements directly with the providers and result in publicly displayed
price points, total number of licenses purchased, and the remaining
number of mailboxes that need to be migrated. This volume pricing would
serve as the base rate for any license purchased by the Government.

Public Dashboard Example (Cloud-Based E-mail)\*

In this scenario, data would be recorded and displayed publicly with the
current negotiated pricing tiers, along with any incentive pricing based
on other factors such as the company’s quarterly sales cycles.

  ---------------------------------- -------------------------------
  Cloud Email Provider A             Quarter/ Price per user/month
  Tier 1: 1-5,000 licenses           Q1-3: 2% discount
                                     Q4: 2.5% discount
  Tier 2: 5,000– 10,000 licenses     Q1-3 2.7% discount
                                     Q4: 3.0%
  Tier 3: 10,000 – 50,000 licenses   Q 1-4: 3.2%
  ---------------------------------- -------------------------------

*\*These numbers are fabricated for this example only.*

A running total of the licenses purchased would be displayed so that at
any time, end users would know the price point. This would be validated
with the companies for the official count.

*Publicly Displayed Information Example:*

**As of 6/29/17 Total Licenses purchased Government-wide: 1,345,000**

Pricing Level= Tier 3, Q2 = \$3.2% discount per user/month

**Total mailboxes to migrate:** 3,000,000

The objectives and expected outcomes would include a more constructive
and mutually-beneficial ecosystem with private sector companies, better
and more transparent pricing for Government agencies, and an increased
variety of available secure solutions. This would also lead to more
consistent implementation and configurations across the Federal
enterprise. Lastly, this would incentivize agencies with smaller budgets
to adopt cloud email earlier.

***Assumptions***

This assessment relies on the following assumptions:

-   Industry and private sector companies are not only willing to come
    to the table, but to actually collaborate with the Federal
    Government in pursuing this new approach to contracting;

-   Industry must be willing to negotiate fair and reasonable tiered
    volume pricing that will be made public. Departments, agencies, and
    industry must agree on metrics and public reporting and tracking of
    agency adoption of cloud email adoption;

-   Agencies must also be active in timely reporting of their data,
    which will be displayed publicly, in order to ensure as specific
    volumes are reached, discounts are provided;

-   The Government has the ability to negotiate a Manufacturer’s
    Agreement that will be accepted by agencies; and

-   This approach is platform agnostic, any cloud-based email provider
    may be eligible to participate; agencies will still need to follow
    competition rules as required to place orders.

***Why This Works***

A common strategy for many chains is to locate near a competitor. For
example, you will almost always see a CVS near a Walgreens or a Burger
King near a McDonalds. You will see food chains across the street or
next to each other in almost any city in the United States. The thinking
is that if it works for the competitor, it will likely work for you.
Studies have shown repeatedly that as chains sprout up in adjacency,
volume also goes up. This strategy is commonly known as the Nash
Equilibrium, a solution concept of non-cooperative competition involving
two or more “players,” where each player knows the equilibrium
strategies of the others and no one has anything to gain by changing
their own strategy.

*Creating the Marketplace with Hotelling’s Law:* In simple terms,
Hotelling’s Law determines that businesses selling similar products tend
to locate as close as possible in order to maintain the maximum amount
of market share possible. Creating a public display and accountability
to the total Government spend for the different types of cloud email and
the number of mailboxes left to be migrated will create this
marketplace.

This strategy also takes into account that re-sellers would still be
able to sell these licenses under existing GSA Schedules and
Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), or NASA SEWP contracts;
however, they would be required to use the current price point, record
the sale into the dashboard, and make their re-seller fees transparent
to Government as the differentiation in competition. Ultimately, this
will save business development and contract negotiation time and effort
between the email providers and the re-sellers, which will drive down
the overhead fees the Government has to pay.

Services, configurations, and prices all negotiated openly and reported
publicly will not only ensure the most competitive rates for Government,
but also create an optimal strategy for the vendors themselves. This
dis-incentivizes vendors from focusing on the highest possible price
point for their services and, instead, refocuses the competition on
performance and quality of the offerings as a distinguishing factor.

Pilot to Test the Hypothesis

The steps outlined below would be used to test the theory that this
would change the way we buy these services and establish a shared
service approach to license purchasing. This is not the full
implementation plan which will provide more details for how and when
these general steps will be accomplished. The implementation plan will
address pilot success criteria to include input and feedback from
agencies and industry which may change the course of the outcome.

**Get Industry Buy-in and Feedback.** Capitalizing on the recent success
of the IT CEO Summit, the Office of American Innovation will call a
follow-up summit with interested cloud providers to discuss the
proposal. The goal would be to determine whether CSPs would be willing
to participate in a pilot with the Federal Government.

**Measure the Market.** A prerequisite to all other actions is to obtain
an accurate measurement of the market need in terms of agencies that
have not yet transitioned to cloud email solutions. While we have clear
data on implementation among the CFO Act agencies, currently there is no
definitive data source of small and independent agencies adoption of
cloud email. In order to negotiate effectively, knowing the size of the
market is imperative, therefore we need a data call to all agencies
regarding their current email contracts, prices, and number of
mailboxes, etc.

**Establish Focused Pilots with Partners.** ATC and OMB will work with a
small group of agencies to establish a pilot program to examine the
impact of the process changes being proposed. Additionally, they will
lead the creation of a series of support groups that would deploy to
agencies to provide technical, acquisition, and migration assistance and
report to ATC on the progress of the pilots. This will include a
strategy to minimize the burden on early adopters, potentially through
price redetermination terms, modular contracting methods, or
collaborative purchase agreements.

**Create a Reporting Mechanism with Agencies and Industry.** The Federal
Government requires that accurate and up-to-date data around the current
state of both cloud and on-premises email adoption be reported by
agencies so as to develop a baseline against which agency progress may
be tracked. Industry sign-off on transparent reporting of units and
volume pricing is essential to the success of this proposal. Without it,
this strategy will ultimately fail. This is the foundation for achieving
Nash Equilibrium for both the Federal Government and industry.

Notional Metrics of Success

-   At least one cloud-based email service provider has signed up to
    negotiate a memorandum of understanding within 90 days of the report
    being published, which would allow the Government to begin capturing
    FY 2018 spending on cloud email migrations;

-   At least two agencies have signed on to pilot the proposed dashboard
    and provide reporting and acquisition of cloud email licenses under
    this effort; and

-   Within 30 days of qualified purchases, agencies or re-sellers will
    record the sale in the dashboard.

**Appendix E: Legal Considerations**

**Introduction**

Executive Order 13800, *Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal
Networks and Critical Infrastructure* requires this report to “describe
the legal . . . considerations . . . relevant to . . .” transitioning
agencies to consolidated network infrastructures or shared services.
Exec. Order No. 13,800, 82 FR 22391, § 1(c)(vi)(B)(2) (May 11, 2017).
This appendix, along with the report itself, does so. The report
suggests increased use of consolidated network architectures and shared
services. Generally, Federal law contemplates that agencies control
their own systems and information either directly or through contract.
Moving to consolidated network architectures, commercial cloud and
shared services generally involves moving away from agency control and
thus tends to increase tension with relevant law and requires greater
analysis and legal documentation. While additional legal review and
documentation would need to be performed during any eventual development
of the consolidated network architectures, commercial cloud, and shared
services based on their exact facts, implementation of the report’s
recommendations can likely be achieved within existing law in most
instances, as long as they are designed with a view toward satisfying
applicable legal requirements. A summary of some of the main areas of
law and legal issues implicated by this report are discussed below.

**The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)**

The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) and
later amendments are codified in subsection II of chapter 35 of title 44
of the U.S. Code. These provisions, which we will refer to here as
FISMA, create a whole-of-Government approach to Federal information
security[^32] pursuant to which OMB oversees agency information security
policies and practices; DHS administers implementation of these policies
and practices for Federal, civilian, executive-branch agencies,
including by assisting agencies and providing certain Government-wide
protections; and agencies are responsible for providing information
security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the
potential harm to their agency information and information systems.
*See* 44 U.S.C. §§ 3551-3558. FISMA also requires agencies to implement
a minimum set of information security controls and techniques, assess
the effectiveness of these controls, comply with NIST standards, DHS
directives, and OMB policies, and report certain cybersecurity
information to DHS, OMB and to Congress. The consolidated network
architectures, commercial cloud, and shared services recommended in this
report will need to provide levels of security and transparency that
enable agency heads to ensure compliance with FISMA and its related
requirements, while also providing technical solutions that fit the
needs of multiple agencies.

**The Homeland Security Act’s Federal Intrusion Detection and Prevention
System**

The Homeland Security Act, as amended, requires DHS to “deploy, operate,
and maintain” and “make available for use by any agency” capabilities to
detect cybersecurity risks in agency network traffic and take actions to
mitigate those risks. 6 U.S.C. § 151(b)(1). DHS currently provides these
capabilities through its EINSTEIN program and, as required by law,
ensures all retention, use, and disclosure of information obtained
through EINSTEIN occurs only for the purpose of protecting information
and information systems from cybersecurity risks. *See id*. § 151(c)(3).
Federal law also requires agencies to apply these capabilities to “all
information traveling between an agency information system and any
information system other than an agency information system.” *Id.*
§ 151, note. Because this statutory mandate defines “agency information
system” as any “system owned or operated by an agency,” the statutory
mandate itself does not always require agencies to apply those
capabilities to systems operated by contractors. But existing policy
requires broader application of EINSTEIN, and DHS and agencies can
choose to apply the capabilities to contractor-operated systems.

**Privacy Statutes**

There are many provisions of law and regulation that that protect
personally identifiable information by, for example, limiting access.
*See, e.g.*, U.S. Const. amend IV; Fed. R. Crim. Pro. 6(e)(2)(B) (grand
jury confidentiality rule); 5 U.S.C. § 552a (Privacy Act of 1974); 26
U.S.C. § 6103 (restrictions on access to tax return information); 13
U.S.C. § 9(a) (Census confidentiality statute); 18 U.S.C. § 2511
(Wiretap Act); 6 U.S.C. § 151 (DHS’s Federal Intrusion Detection and
Prevention System). Personnel operating consolidated network
architectures, commercial cloud, and shared services described in this
report will sometimes require access to such information. Technical
capabilities and administrative processes will need to be developed to
enable compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to each type
of information. This will require a significant role for SAOPs and
agency privacy programs.

**Request for Information from Third Parties**

Agencies receive requests for information in their possession through
various means, including, for example, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
requests, Privacy Act requests, congressional requests, Government
Accountability Office audits, Inspector General inquiries, court
proceedings, requests from the White House or other agencies, and other
legal process. Legal agreements between shared service providers and
client agencies will be required to define who will be responsible for
responding to such requests when the information resides in a shared
service in a way that satisfies legal requirements and provides agencies
with sufficient control over their own information. Likewise, agency
notices and regulations should adequately inform the public and others
who might make requests of the appropriate procedures for accessing
information.

**The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)**

The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)
increases the authority of agency Chief Information Officers to play a
significant role in the planning, programming, budgeting, management,
governance and oversight of Federal information technology. 40 U.S.C. §
11319(b)(1)(A). FITARA is consistent with a move toward consolidated
network architectures, commercial cloud, and shared services and
enhances the legal authority for agency CIOs move in that direction.
Among other actions, FITARA and associated policy require agencies to
implement data center consolidation strategies that support (i) movement
of information technology infrastructure to the as-a-service model and
(ii) transition to the cloud. *See* 44 U.S.C. § 3601, note.

**Procurement and Fiscal Considerations**

Transitioning to consolidated network architectures and shared services
requires consideration of how those products or services will be
acquired and funded. In order to consolidate and share services with
each other, Federal agencies will need to enter into Interagency
Agreements or other appropriate agreements with each other that outline
the parameters of their relationship and the applicable authorities that
govern, for example, the acquisition of the products or services, how
they will be shared and utilized by the parties, and how they will be
funded and reimbursed. The specific authorities may vary depending on
the circumstances and agencies affected, but may include:

-   The Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535, which authorizes Federal agencies
    to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from
    another Federal agency and requires full reimbursement.

-   Agency-specific authorities. For example, 40 U.S.C. § 501 authorized
    GSA to procure and supply property and services for executive
    agencies. The funding source utilized in conjunction with 40
    U.S.C. § 501 will depend on which office within GSA is providing
    the property and services, but may include the Acquisition
    Services Fund (40 U.S.C. § 321), a Working Capital Fund, or other
    specific authorities. In general, full reimbursement will be
    required unless specifically authorized otherwise. In an example
    of such a specific authorization, 44 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(6)(B)
    authorizes DHS to “upon request by an agency, deploy\[\],
    operate\[\], and maintain\[\] technology to assist the agency to
    continuously diagnose and mitigate against cyber threats and
    vulnerabilities, with or without reimbursement.”

**Appendix G: Summary of Comments Received**

More than 100 companies and individuals submitted comments during the
three week public comment period for the IT Modernization Report.
Overall, the comments reaffirmed the importance of modernizing Federal
IT, and validated that the proposed approach is on the right track. The
comments offered diverse and at times conflicting suggestions, and
ranged from strategic thoughts to detailed implementation guidance.

The ATC strove to keep this report at a strategic level, and will make
the more detailed ‘implementation level’ comments available to the teams
who will drive specific modernization efforts across Federal IT. Several
comments also noted the need to fundamentally reform or tweak current
statutory provisions, and the ATC will provide these recommendations to
existing activities which are already charged with these statutory
reform areas.

All comments received are publically posted, but this appendix will
highlight some of the key themes that emerged during the comment review.

**Need for technical diversity and efficiency**

Many comments stressed the need to future-proof the Government’s
systems, keep pace with innovation and future standards, maintain vendor
and technology neutrality, and recognize the validity of diverse
approaches to securing data, applications, networks, and services.
Comments also suggested adopting modern approaches to development and
operations such as DevOps and continuous delivery and automate more of
the functional/security testing, integration, deployment, and operations
of applications.

**Accreditation and cybersecurity**

Comments emphasized the benefits of leveraging FedRAMP authorization,
suggested improvements to the FedRAMP process, asserted need to enforce
reciprocity, suggested utilizing the native security capabilities (such
as machine learning and big data analytics) offered by the cloud service
providers, and potential for automating the sharing of classified threat
intelligence with cleared service providers.

**Network modernization and data level security**

Comments emphasized the importance of network level security, advised
that tools should focus on outcomes not mechanisms, that controls must
be placed in closer proximity to the data, and that users, cloud APIs,
and individual devices need to be considered as access control shifts
from the network perimeter. Comments also emphasized that controls must
be placed in closer proximity to the data, and that cloud access
security brokers (CASBs) should be used to provide secure access to
cloud resources.

**Acquisition strategy and workforce **

Several comments indicated concern over halting or pausing acquisitions
in progress, the need for reform of the acquisition and budgeting
processes, and observations that acquisition cycles needed to become
more rapid and agile. Comments also suggested that the acquisition of
modern IT requires a holistic approach (technical, cybersecurity, and
contracting) supported by a trained and experienced workforce.

**Shared services and the acquisition pilot**

Comments suggested that the discussion and policy around shared service
be clarified. Several comments mentioned that contract consolidation on
EIS was essential, while others mentioned that the strategy might stifle
innovation and competition. The ATC is committed to the strategy of
leveraging the competitively awarded EIS contract to assist with
consolidation efforts. Comments suggested that the acquisition pilot
would be useful in proving out the Government’s objectives, while others
suggested it too narrowly scoped. Comments also recommended that
specific vendor names be removed from the notional examples in the
appendix.

Examples of key points derived from the comments is included in the
section below.

**Question 1 - What are major attributes that are missing from the
targeted vision? (Appendix A, Appendix B)**

Comments, in response to this question suggested the report should:

> \(i) make clear the section only described some of the approaches to be
> used;
>
> \(ii) include the concept of logical vice physical separation of data;
>
> \(iii) consider including multi-factor authentication;
>
> \(iv) consider including the concept of least privilege;
>
> \(v) consider expanding the discussion regarding software lifecycle
> automation and security testing.

Many of the comments confirmed that the attributes were on the right
track or offered additional suggestions and insights to attributes
proffered within the report.

**Question 2 - What are major attributes that should not be included in
the targeted vision?**

Comments, in response to this question, suggested the report should:

> \(i) remove references to specific companies;
>
> \(ii) remove or revise the suggestion that agencies halt procurement
> actions that are underway;
>
> \(iii) expand the description and approaches to cybersecurity assessment
> and authorization.

Many of the comments confirmed that the attributes were on the right
track or offered additional suggestions and insights to attributes
proffered within the report.

**Question 3 - Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for
implementing network modernization & consolidation? **

**Question 4 - Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for
implementing shared services to enable future network architectures? **

Comments and recommendations in response to questions 3 and 4 were
similar and suggested or implied that the report:

> \(i) should clarify the definition, description, and/or purpose of
> employing shared services;
>
> \(ii) should identify and address obstacles to adopting shared services
> or network consolidation;
>
> \(iii) should, relative to item (ii) recommend that a greater focus and
> actions be placed on addressing issues relative to the FAR;
>
> \(iv) should acknowledge need to reuse existing accreditation packages
> (aka foster reciprocity among agencies);
>
> \(v) relative to item (iv) above, should suggest an activity to improve
> reciprocity and identify capabilities to automate NIST RMF Framework;
>
> \(vi) reinforce the need for training and career development for
> professionals involved in accomplishing the goals articulated in the
> report.

Many of the comments confirmed that the tasks were appropriate and/or
offered additional enhancement to the identified tasks.

**Question 5 What is the feasibility of the proposed acquisition pilot?
(Appendix D)**

Comments, in response to this question, suggested that the report:

> \(i) should clarify the intent, purpose, scope, expected outcomes, and
> assessment criteria of-and-for the pilot;
>
> \(ii) should consider expanding the pilot to other shared services;
>
> \(iii) should de-identify service providers and include contracting
> options.

The comments generally confirmed that a pilot was a valid idea and
offered additional suggestions, approaches, and identified potential
pit-falls.

We want to express appreciation for the sincerity, depth of thought, and
time taken by each of the commenters and encourage the community to go
to the public website and read each of the submissions.
